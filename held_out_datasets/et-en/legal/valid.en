The European Union Solidarity Fund ('the Fund') aims to enable the Union to respond in a rapid, efficient and flexible manner to emergency situations in order to show solidarity with the population of regions struck by natural disasters.
The Fund is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 500000000 (2011 prices), as laid down in Article 10 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013.
On 11 January 2018, Bulgaria submitted an application to mobilise the Fund, following a flooding caused by intense rainfall and violent storms of 25 and 26 October 2017.
On 11 October 2017, Greece submitted an application to mobilise the Fund, following an earthquake that affected the South Aegean region and the island of Kos on 20 July 2017.
On 22 December 2017, Lithuania submitted an application to mobilise the Fund, following a flooding caused by continuous rainfall during summer and autumn 2017.
On 25 October 2017, Poland submitted an application to mobilise the Fund, following exceptionally violent storms and heavy rainfall that occurred between 9 and 12 August 2017.
The applications by Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania and Poland meet the conditions for providing a financial contribution from the Fund, as laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002.
The Fund should therefore be mobilised in order to provide a financial contribution to Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania and Poland.
In order to minimise the time taken to mobilise the Fund, this Decision should apply from the date of its adoption,

Member States shall transmit data relating to inland waterways transport on their national territory to the Commission (Eurostat).
Member States in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds 1000000 tonnes shall supply the data referred to in Article 4 (1).
By way of derogation from paragraph 2, Member States which do not have international or transit inland waterways transport but in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national transport exceeds 1000000 tonnes shall supply only the data required under Article 4 (2).
This Regulation shall not apply to:
the carriage of goods by vessels of less than 50 deadweight tonnes;
vessels used principally for the carriage of passengers;
vessels used for ferrying purposes;
vessels used solely for non-commercial purposes by port administrations and public authorities;
vessels used solely for bunkering or storage;

The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 10 concerning the amendment of paragraph 2 of this Article in order to raise the threshold for statistical coverage of inland waterways transport referred to therein so as to take economic and technical trends into account.
When exercising that power, the Commission shall ensure that the delegated acts do not impose a significant additional burden on the Member States or on the respondents.
Furthermore, the Commission shall duly justify the statistical actions for which those delegated acts provide, using, where appropriate, a cost-effectiveness analysis, including an assessment of the burden on respondents and of the production costs as referred to in Article 14 (3) (c) of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.
Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013
Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 is amended as follows:
In Article 7, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
For each Member State and for each calendar year, the estimated product of the reduction of payments referred to in Article 11 (which is reflected by the difference between the national ceiling set out in Annex II, to which is added the amount available in accordance with Article 58, and the net ceiling set out in Annex III) shall be made available as Union support financed under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
In Article 11 (6), the following subparagraph is added:
"For the year 2020, Member States shall notify the Commission of the decisions taken in accordance with this Article and of any estimated product of reductions by 31 December 2019."
Article 14 is amended as follows:
in paragraph 1, the following subparagraph is added:
"By 31 December 2019, Member States may decide to make available, as additional support financed under the EAFRD in financial year 2021, up to 15% of their annual national ceilings for the calendar year 2020 set out in Annex II to this Regulation. As a result, the corresponding amount shall no longer be available for granting direct payments. That decision shall be notified to the Commission by 31 December 2019 and shall set out the percentage chosen."
in paragraph 2, the following subparagraph is added:
"By 31 December 2019, Member States may decide to make available as direct payments up to 15%, or in the case of Bulgaria, Estonia, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden up to 25%, of the amount allocated to support financed under the EAFRD in financial year 2021 by Union legislation adopted after the adoption by the Council of the relevant Regulation pursuant to Article 312 (2) TFEU. As a result, the corresponding amount shall no longer be available for support financed under the EAFRD. That decision shall be notified to the Commission by 31 December 2019 and shall set out the percentage chosen."
In Article 22, paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:
If the ceiling for a Member State set by the Commission pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article is different from that of the previous year as a result of any decision taken by that Member State in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, Article 14 (1) or (2), Article 42 (1), the second subparagraph of Article 49 (1), the second subparagraph of Article 51 (1), or Article 53, that Member State shall linearly reduce or increase the value of all payment entitlements in order to ensure compliance with paragraph 4 of this Article.
Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 [3] has been substantially amended [4].
Since further amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity.
In the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy, reference is made to the characteristics of fishing vessels, such as length, breadth, tonnage, date of entry into service and engine power.
It is essential that identical rules for determining the characteristics of fishing vessels be used in order to unify the conditions for the pursuit of the activity in the Union.
Those rules should be in line with the standards of the Common Fisheries Policy.
The definitions laid down in this Regulation should be based upon initiatives already taken by specialist international organisations.
Therefore, account should be taken of the United Nations Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas, signed in Geneva on 29 April 1958, the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, signed in London on 23 June 1969 (the '1969 Convention') and the International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, signed in Torremolinos on 2 April 1977.
For fishing vessels with a length overall of less than 15 metres, the methodology laid down in Annex I to the 1969 Convention is in certain cases inappropriate.
Therefore, for those vessels a simpler definition of gross tonnage is desirable.
The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) has drawn up standards on internal combustion engines which are widely applied in Member States.
In order to adapt the reference to the relevant ISO International Standard setting out the requirements for the determination of the continuous engine power to technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of the necessary amendments to the reference to the relevant ISO International Standard.
It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making [5].
In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts,
Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 is amended as follows:
In Article 91, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
The resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion available for budgetary commitment for the period 2014-2020 shall be EUR 329982345366 in 2011 prices, in accordance with the annual breakdown set out in Annex VI, of which EUR 325938694233 represents the global resources allocated to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund and EUR 4043651133 represents a specific allocation for the YEI.
For the purposes of programming and subsequent inclusion in the budget of the Union, the amount of resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion shall be indexed at 2% per year.
Article 92 is amended as follows:
paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
Resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal shall amount to 96,09% of the global resources (i.e., a total of EUR 317073545392) and shall be allocated as follows:
51,52% (i.e., a total of EUR 163359380738) for less developed regions;
10,82% (i.e., a total of EUR 34319221039) for transition regions;
16,33% (i.e., a total of EUR 51773321432) for more developed regions;
20,89% (i.e., a total of EUR 66236030665) for Member States supported by the Cohesion Fund;
0,44% (i.e., a total of EUR 1385591518) as additional funding for the outermost regions identified in Article 349 TFEU and the NUTS level 2 regions fulfilling the criteria laid down in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession.;
paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:
Resources for the YEI shall amount to EUR 4043651133 from the specific allocation for the YEI and at least EUR 4043651133 from ESF targeted investment.
Annex VI is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council [4] establishes a common statistical classification of territorial units (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, referred to as 'NUTS') in order to enable the collection, compilation and dissemination of harmonised regional statistics in the European Union.
The Commission, in collaboration with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, has defined a number of basic and most relevant territorial typologies to classify the statistical units established by Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003.
The European Statistical System already uses those typologies, in particular the degree of urbanisation, which includes the definition of cities.
The codification of the typologies is necessary in order to set out unambiguous definitions of and conditions for territorial types, ensuring their harmonised and transparent application and making the typologies stable in order to support the compilation and dissemination of European statistics.
Those statistical typologies are without prejudice to the identification of specific areas for Union policies.
A system of statistical grids should apply to calculate and attribute the territorial types to the regions and areas in question, since those types depend on the population distribution and density in grid cells of one square kilometre.
A number of minor aspects of the local administrative units (LAU) should also be clarified to simplify terminology and the delivery mechanism of the lists of LAU from the Member States to the Commission (Eurostat).
In order to adapt to corresponding developments in the Member States, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending, in accordance with the information communicated by Member States, the NUTS classification in Annex I, the list of existing administrative units in Annex II and the list of LAU in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003.
It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making [5].
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of the application of territorial typologies and the time series the Member States are to transmit to the Commission in case of any amendment to the NUTS classification.
Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council [6].
Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the harmonisation of regional classification, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.
Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,
Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 is amended as follows:
In Article 91, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
The resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion available for budgetary commitment for the period 2014-2020 shall be EUR 329978401458 in 2011 prices, in accordance with the annual breakdown set out in Annex VI, of which EUR 325938694233 represents the global resources allocated to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund, and EUR 4039707225 represents a specific allocation for the YEI.
For the purposes of programming and subsequent inclusion in the budget of the Union, the amount of resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion shall be indexed at 2% per year.
Article 92 is amended as follows:
Resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal shall amount to 96,09% of the global resources (i.e., a total of EUR 317103114309) and shall be allocated as follows:
48,64% (i.e., a total of EUR 160498028177) for less developed regions;
10,19% (i.e., a total of EUR 33621675154) for transition regions;
15,43% (i.e., a total of EUR 50914723304) for more developed regions;
20,01% (i.e., a total of EUR 66029882135) for Member States supported by the Cohesion Fund;
0,42% (i.e., a total of EUR 1378882914) as additional funding for the outermost regions identified in Article 349 TFEU and the NUTS level 2 regions fulfilling the criteria laid down in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession.;
Resources for the YEI shall amount to EUR 4039707225 from the specific allocation for the YEI and at least EUR 4039707225 from ESF targeted investment.;
paragraph 9 is replaced by the following:
Resources for the European territorial cooperation goal shall amount to 2,69% of the global resources available for budgetary commitment from the Funds for the period 2014-2020 (i.e., a total of EUR 8865148841).
Annex VI is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
Council Decision 2003/17/EC provides that, under certain conditions, field inspections carried out on certain seed-producing crops in the listed third countries are to be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union law and that, under certain conditions, the seed of certain species of fodder plants, cereal, beet, and oil and fibre plants produced in those countries is to be considered equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union law.
The Federative Republic of Brazil ('Brazil') has submitted a request to the Commission to grant equivalence to its system of field inspections of fodder plant seed-producing crops and cereal seed-producing crops, and to fodder plant seed and cereal seed produced and certified in Brazil.
The Commission examined the relevant legislation of Brazil, and, based on an audit carried out in 2016 concerning the system of official controls and of certification of fodder plant and cereal seed in Brazil, and its equivalence with Union requirements, published its findings in a report entitled 'Final report of an audit carried out in Brazil from 11 April 2016 to 19 April 2016 in order to evaluate the system of official controls and certification of seed and its equivalence with European Union requirements.
Following the audit, it has been concluded that field inspections of seed-producing crops, sampling, testing and official post-controls of fodder plant and cereal seed are carried out appropriately, and satisfy the conditions set out in Annex II to Decision 2003/17/EC and the respective requirements set out in Council Directives 66/401/EEC and 66/402/EEC.
Moreover, it has been concluded that the national authorities responsible for the implementation of seed certification in Brazil are competent and operate appropriately.
The Republic of Moldova has submitted a request to the Commission to grant equivalence to its system of field inspections of cereal seed-producing crops, vegetable seed-producing crops and oil and fibre plant seed-producing crops and to cereal seed, vegetable seed and oil and fibre plant seed produced and certified in the Republic of Moldova.
The Commission examined the relevant legislation of the Republic of Moldova, and, based on an audit carried out in 2016 concerning the system of official controls and of certification of cereal, vegetable and oil and fibre plant seed in the Republic of Moldova, and its equivalence with Union requirements, published its findings in a report entitled 'Final report of an audit carried out in the Republic of Moldova from 14 June to 21 June 2016 in order to evaluate the system of official controls and certification of seed and their equivalence with European Union requirements.
Following the audit, it has been concluded that field inspections of seed-producing crops, sampling, testing and official post-controls of cereal, vegetable and oil and fibre plant seed are carried out appropriately, and satisfy the conditions set out in Annex II to Decision 2003/17/EC and the respective requirements set out in Council Directives 66/402/EEC, 2002/55/EC and 2002/57/EC.
Moreover, it has been concluded that the national authorities responsible for the implementation of seed certification in the Republic of Moldova are competent and operate appropriately.
Therefore it is appropriate to grant equivalence as regards field inspections carried out in respect of fodder plant seed-producing crops and cereal seed-producing crops in Brazil, and as regards fodder plant seed and cereal seed produced in Brazil and officially certified by its authorities.
It is also appropriate to grant equivalence as regards field inspections carried out in respect of cereal seed-producing crops, vegetable seed-producing crops and oil and fibre plant seed-producing crops in the Republic of Moldova, and as regards cereal seed, vegetable seed and oil and fibre plant seed produced in the Republic of Moldova and officially certified by its authorities.
There is a demand in the Union to import vegetable seed from third countries including the Republic of Moldova.
Therefore, Decision 2003/17/EC should cover officially certified vegetable seed as referred to in Directive 2002/55/EC in order to address the demand for those seeds originating in the Republic of Moldova, as well as in other third countries in the future.
Taking into consideration the applicable rules of the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA), it is appropriate that the third country concerned provide an official statement that the seed has been sampled and tested in accordance with the provisions set out in the ISTA International Rules for Seed Testing ('ISTA Rules') with regard to Orange International Seed Lot Certificates, and that the seed lots be accompanied by such a certificate.
In view of the expiry of the 'Derogatory experiment on seed sampling and seed analysis' set out in Annex V (A) to the Decision adopted by the Council of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on 28 September 2000 on the OECD Schemes for the Varietal Certification of Seed Moving in International Trade, any reference to that experiment should be deleted.
Any reference to Croatia as a third country should be deleted, in view of its accession to the Union in 2013.
Decision 2003/17/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,
General requirements of on-board diagnostic systems
L-category vehicles, with the exception of L1e, L2e and L6e vehicles, shall be equipped with an OBD system which complies with the functional requirements and test procedures laid down in the delegated acts referred to in paragraph 8 and as from the application dates set out in Annex IV.
From the dates set out in point 1.8.1 of Annex IV, vehicle categories and subcategories L3e, L4e, L5e-A and L7e-A shall be equipped with an OBD stage I system which monitors any electric circuit and electronics failure of the emission control system and reports those failures which result in the emission thresholds laid down in Annex VI (B1) being exceeded.
From the dates set out in point 1.8.2 of Annex IV, vehicle categories and subcategories L3e, L4e, L5e and L7e shall be equipped with an OBD stage I system which monitors any electric circuit and electronics failure of the emission control system and which triggers a report when the emission thresholds laid down in Annex VI (B1) are exceeded.
OBD stage I systems for those vehicle categories and subcategories shall also report the triggering of any operating mode which significantly reduces engine torque.
From the dates set out in point 1.8.3 of Annex IV, vehicle categories L3e, L4e, L5e and L7e shall be equipped with an OBD stage I system which monitors any electric circuit and electronics failure of the emission control system and which triggers a report when the emission thresholds laid down in Annex VI (B2) are exceeded.
OBD stage I systems for those vehicle categories shall also report the triggering of any operating mode which significantly reduces engine torque.
From the dates set out in point 1.8.4 of Annex IV, vehicle categories and subcategories L3e, L4e, L5e-A and L7e-A shall in addition be equipped with an OBD stage II system which monitors and reports emission control system failures and degradation, with the exception of catalyst monitoring, which result in the OBD emission thresholds laid down in Annex VI (B1) being exceeded.
From the dates set out in point 1.8.5 of Annex IV, vehicle categories and subcategories L3e, L4e, L5e-A and L7e-A shall in addition be equipped with an OBD stage II system which monitors and reports emission control system failures and degradation which result in the OBD emission thresholds laid down in Annex VI (B2) being exceeded.
Paragraphs 5 and 6 shall not apply to enduro motorcycles in subcategory L3e-AxE and trial motorcycles in subcategory L3e-AxT.
In order to harmonise the OBD system reporting of functional safety or emission control system faults and facilitate effective and efficient repair of a vehicle, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 75 supplementing this Regulation by laying down the detailed technical requirements related to on-board diagnostics with respect to vehicle categories and subcategories as set out in Annex II, C1 - Vehicle construction and general type-approval requirements, the row relating to No 11, including functional OBD requirements and test procedures for the subjects listed in paragraphs 1 to 7 of this Article, and the detailed technical requirements related to test type VIII referred to in Annex V.
In Article 23 (3), point (c) is replaced by the following:
mathematical durability procedure:
Until 31 December 2024, for each emission constituent, the product of the multiplication of the deterioration factor set out in Annex VII (B) and the environmental performance test result of a vehicle which has accumulated more than 100 km after it was first started at the end of the production line shall be lower than the environmental performance test limit set out in Annex VI (A).
Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, for new types of vehicles from 1 January 2020 and for existing types of vehicles from 1 January 2021 until 31 December 2024, for each emission constituent the product of the multiplication of the deterioration factor set out in Annex VII (B) and the environmental performance test result of a vehicle which has accumulated more than 2500 km for a vehicle with a maximum design vehicle speed of < 130 km/h and 3500 km for a vehicle with a maximum design vehicle speed of ≥ 130 km/h after it was first started at the end of the production line shall be lower than the tailpipe emission limit set out in Annex VI (A).
In Article 30 (1), point (b) is replaced by the following:
the test results sheet;
In Article 44 (1), the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:
"The first subparagraph shall apply only to vehicles within the territory of the Union which were covered by a valid EU type-approval at the time of their production, but which neither were registered nor entered into service before that EU type-approval lost its validity."
Article 75 (2) is replaced by the following:
The Paris Agreement, inter alia, sets out a long-term goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature increase well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep it to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels.
It also stresses the importance to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and to make finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.
The Paris Agreement also calls for a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, and invites Parties to take action to conserve and enhance, as appropriate, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases, including forests.
In its conclusions of 29-30 October 2009, the European Council supported a Union objective, in the context of necessary reductions according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by developed countries as a group, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels.
The nationally determined contributions of the Parties to the Paris Agreement are to reflect their highest possible ambition and represent a progression over time.
In addition, Parties to the Paris Agreement should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, mindful of the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
The Council conclusions of 13 October 2017 recognise the importance of the long-term goals and the five-year review cycles in the implementation of the Paris Agreement and highlight the importance of long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies as a policy tool for developing reliable pathways and the long-term policy changes needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
The transition to clean energy requires changes in investment behaviour and incentives across the entire policy spectrum.
It is a key Union priority to establish a resilient Energy Union to provide secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy to its citizens.
Achieving that requires continuation of ambitious climate action with this Regulation and progress on the other aspects of the Energy Union as set out in the Commission communication of 25 February 2015 entitled 'A Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy'.
A range of Union measures enhance Member States' ability to meet their climate commitments and are crucial to achieving necessary greenhouse gas emission reductions in the sectors covered by this Regulation.
Those measures include legislation on fluorinated greenhouse gases, CO2-reductions from road vehicles, energy performance of buildings, renewables, energy efficiency and circular economy, as well as Union funding instruments for climate-related investments.
The conclusions of the European Council of 19-20 March 2015 noted that the Union is committed to building an Energy Union with a forward-looking climate policy on the basis of the Commission's framework strategy, whose five dimensions are closely interrelated and mutually reinforcing.
Moderation of energy demand is one of the five dimensions of that Energy Union strategy.
Improving energy efficiency can deliver significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
It can also benefit the environment and health, improve energy security, cut energy costs for households and companies, help alleviate energy poverty and lead to increased jobs and economy-wide economic activity.
Measures which contribute to an increased uptake of energy-saving technologies in buildings, industry and transport could be a cost-effective way of helping Member States achieve their targets under this Regulation.
The deployment and development of sustainable and innovative practices and technologies can enhance the role of the agricultural sector in relation to climate mitigation and adaptation, in particular by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and by maintaining and enhancing sinks and carbon stocks.
To reduce the carbon and ecological footprint of the agricultural sector, whilst maintaining its productivity, regeneration capacity and vitality, it is important to enhance action on climate mitigation and adaption as well as research funding for the development of and investments in sustainable and innovative practices and technologies.
The agricultural sector has direct and significant impact on biodiversity and ecosystems.
For that reason, it is important to ensure the coherence between the objective of this Regulation and other Union policies and objectives, such as the common agricultural policy and objectives related to the biodiversity strategy, the forestry strategy and circular economy strategy.
The transport sector represents almost a quarter of the Union's greenhouse gas emissions.
Such prohibition of secondary market operations is inconsistent with the general principles underlying Union measures for the approximation of laws relating to products and should therefore be removed.
Certain niche product groups should be excluded from the scope of Directive 2011/65/EU as their inclusion would bring negligible environmental or health benefits and introduce unresolvable compliance problems or market distortions that cannot effectively be addressed through the exemption mechanism provided for in that Directive.
Pipes in organs are built using a specific type of lead-based alloy, for which no alternative has been found so far.
Most pipe organs are kept in the same place for centuries and their turnover rate is negligible.
Pipe organs should therefore be excluded from the scope of Directive 2011/65/EU as their inclusion would bring negligible benefit in terms of the substitution of lead.
Directive 2011/65/EU does not apply to non-road mobile machinery with an on-board power source, which is made available exclusively for professional use.
However, for certain types of non-road mobile machinery, two versions are produced in the same production line, with the power source (either on-board or external) being the only difference.
Those versions should be treated in the same way under that Directive.
Non-road mobile machinery with a traction drive powered by an external power source should therefore also be excluded from the scope of Directive 2011/65/EU.
For all relevant EEE categories, as set out in Annex I to Directive 2011/65/EU, the conditions for the exemption of reused spare parts, recovered from EEE, should be clearly specified.
Likewise, since exemptions from the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances should have a limited duration, the maximum validity period for existing exemptions should also be clearly specified for all relevant EEE categories, including for category 11.
When an application for renewal of an exemption is submitted, the Commission is required to take a decision no later than 6 months before the expiry date of the existing exemption, unless specific circumstances justify a different deadline.
No deadline is specified for the Commission to take a decision on applications for new exemptions.
According to the report of 18 April 2016 from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the exercise of the power to adopt delegated acts conferred on the Commission pursuant to Directive 2011/65/EU, that deadline has proven to be unfeasible in practice, due to the need to follow several mandatory procedural steps for the evaluation of an application for renewal of an exemption.
While the deadline brings no additional value to the existing procedure for the evaluation of applications for renewal, it entails uncertainties for businesses and other stakeholders due to its impracticability.
On the other hand, business continuity is ensured since market operators are able to rely on an existing exemption remaining valid until a decision is taken on the application for renewal.
Therefore, the provision related to the deadline should be removed.
However, the Commission should provide to the applicant, the Member States and the European Parliament, shortly after the receipt of an application, a timeline for the adoption of its decision on the application.
Furthermore, the general review of Directive 2011/65/EU to be carried out by the Commission no later than 22 July 2021 should include the specification of a realistic deadline for a decision by the Commission on an application for renewal of an exemption before the expiry of the relevant exemption.
Since the objectives of this Directive, which are to contribute to the protection of human health and the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE by means of the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in EEE, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because disparities between the laws or administrative measures adopted by the Member States could create barriers to trade and distort competition in the Union and thus have a direct impact on the internal market, but can rather, by reason of the scale of the problem and its implications in respect of other Union legislation on recovery and disposal of waste and areas of common interest, such as human health protection, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.
In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,
Each company assuming responsibility for operating a passenger ship shall, where required under Articles 4 and 5 of this Directive, appoint a passenger registrar responsible for reporting the information referred to in those provisions in the single window established pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 2010/65/EU or to the designated authority by means of the Automatic Identification System.
Personal data collected in accordance with Article 5 of this Directive shall be kept by the company no longer than is necessary for the purposes of this Directive, and in any event only until the moment the ship's voyage in question has been safely completed and the data has been reported in the single window established pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 2010/65/EU.
Without prejudice to other specific legal obligations under Union or national law, including for statistical purposes, once the information is no longer needed for this purpose, it shall be erased automatically and without undue delay.
Each company shall ensure that information concerning passengers who have declared a need for special care or assistance in emergency situations is properly recorded and communicated to the master before the passenger ship departs.
paragraph 2 is amended as follows:
point (a) is deleted;
points (b) and (c) are replaced by the following:
A Member State from whose port a passenger ship departs may exempt it from the obligation to report the number of persons on board in the single window established pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 2010/65/EU, provided that the ship concerned is not a high speed craft, it operates regular services of less than one hour between port calls exclusively in sea area D established pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2009/45/EC and the proximity of search and rescue facilities is ensured in that sea area.
A Member State may exempt passenger ships sailing between two ports or from and to the same port without intermediate calls from the obligations laid down in Article 5 of this Directive, provided that the ship concerned operates exclusively in sea area D established pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2009/45/EC, and the proximity of search and rescue facilities is ensured in that sea area.
following subparagraph is added:
By way of derogation from Article 5 (2) and without prejudice to the transitional period laid down in Article 5 (3), the following Member States shall have the right to apply the following exemptions:
Germany may extend the periods for the collection and reporting of information referred to in Article 5 (1) to one hour after departure in the case of passenger ships operating from and to the Island of Heligoland; and
Denmark and Sweden may extend the periods for the collection and reporting of information referred to in Article 5 (1) to one hour after departure in the case of passenger ships operating from and to the Island of Bornholm.;
in paragraph 3, points (a) and (b) are replaced by the following:
the Member State shall without delay notify the Commission of its decision to grant an exemption from the obligations laid down in Article 5, giving its substantive reasons for doing so.
This notification shall be carried out by means of a database established and maintained by the Commission for that purpose, to which the Commission and Member States shall have access.
The Commission shall make the adopted measures available on a publicly accessible website;
if within 6 months of such notification the Commission considers that the exemption is not justified or could have adverse effects on competition, the Commission may adopt implementing acts, requiring the Member State to amend or withdraw its decision.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 13 (2).;
in paragraph 4, the third subparagraph is replaced by the following:
"The request shall be submitted to the Commission by means of the database referred to in paragraph 3. If within 6 months of such request the Commission considers that the derogation is not justified or could have adverse effects on competition, the Commission may adopt implementing acts, requiring the Member State to amend or not to adopt the proposed decision. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 13 (2)."
Article 10 is replaced by the following:
In the Joint statement on European Union Development Policy entitled 'The European Consensus' [2], and in the Joint statement on 'The New European Consensus on Development' [3], the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission recognised the link between security and development.
In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by a Resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015, the importance of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies both as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 and in order to achieve other development policy outcomes was underlined.
SDG 16.a specifically requests to "Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacities at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime."
The primary objective of Union development policy is the reduction and, in the long term, the eradication of poverty.
In the High Level Meeting Communiqué of 19 February 2016, the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development updated the reporting directives on Official Development Assistance in the field of peace and security.
The financing of the actions undertaken in accordance with this Regulation constitutes Official Development Assistance when it fulfils the criteria set out in those reporting directives or any subsequent reporting directives, which the Development Assistance Committee is able to agree upon.
Giving support to security sector actors in third countries, including, under exceptional circumstances, the military, in a conflict prevention, crisis management or stabilisation context is essential to ensure appropriate conditions for poverty eradication and development.
Good governance, effective democratic control and civilian oversight of the security system, including of the military, as well as compliance with human rights and the rule of law principles are essential attributes of a well-functioning State in any context, and should be promoted through a wider security sector reform support to third countries.
In its conclusions of 19-20 December 2013 on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), the European Council emphasised the importance of supporting partner countries and regional organisations, through providing training, advice, equipment and resources where appropriate, so that they can increasingly prevent or manage crises by themselves.
In the Joint Communication of 28 April 2015 entitled "Capacity building in support of security and development - Enabling partners to prevent and manage crisis," the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy reiterated the need for stable and secure societies in order to achieve development objectives.
In line with the EU Comprehensive Approach and in order to maximise the impact, efficiency and consistency of EU support, the Council in its conclusions of 18 May 2015 on CSDP invited the Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to develop, in consultation with Member States, a Union-wide strategic framework to support security sector reform.
That policy concept brings together CSDP and all other relevant tools of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) as well as development cooperation instruments, while respecting their respective legal bases, primary objectives and decision-making procedures.
Capacity building of military actors in third countries should be undertaken as part of the Union's development cooperation policy when it mainly pursues objectives in the field of development and as part of the Union's CFSP when it mainly pursues objectives in the field of peace and security, in compliance with Article 40 of the Treaty on European Union.
This Regulation respects the application of the procedures and the extent of the powers of the institutions under the Union's development cooperation policy and the Union's CFSP.
Union assistance under this Regulation could cover the provision of capacity building programmes in support of development and security for development, including training, mentoring and advice on, for example, human rights, governance and the rule of law, the protection of women and children, civilian crisis response, human resources management and technical cooperation.
The Commission is to monitor measures under this Regulation closely.
The Commission is to keep the European Parliament duly informed, in a timely manner, about the implementation of Union assistance pursuant to this Regulation.
No later than 30 June 2020, the Commission is to evaluate the impact, effectiveness and coherence of measures pursuant to this Regulation with the SDG 16.
To that end, the Commission is to associate all relevant stakeholders, including civil society organisations and local authorities, in the evaluation phase ensuring they play a meaningful role in the process.
The Commission is to undertake, where appropriate, joint evaluations with Member States.
The results are to inform programme design and resource allocation, and to further enhance the consistency and complementarity of the Union's external action.
Regulation (EU) No 230/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council [4] should therefore be amended accordingly,
Conduct of investigation
Following the publication of the notice of initiation in accordance with Article 5 (7) and (8), the Commission shall initiate an investigation.
The Commission may request Member States to supply information, and Member States shall take all necessary steps to give effect to any such requests.
If the requested information is of general interest and is not confidential within the meaning of Article 12, it shall be added to the non-confidential file as provided for in paragraph 8 of this Article.
Where possible, the investigation shall be concluded within six months from the date on which the notice of initiation is published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
That time limit may be extended by a further period of three months in exceptional circumstances, such as the involvement of an unusually high number of interested parties or complex market situations.
The Commission shall notify all interested parties of any such extensions and explain the reasons therefor.
The Commission shall seek all information that it considers necessary to determine the conditions set out in Article 3 (1) and shall, where appropriate, verify that information.
The Commission shall evaluate all relevant factors of an objective and quantifiable nature that affect the situation of the Union industry, in particular the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute and relative terms, the share of the domestic market taken by the increased imports, and changes regarding the Union industry with respect to the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment.
This list is not exhaustive, and the Commission may take other relevant factors into consideration for its determination of the existence of serious injury or threat of serious injury, such as stocks, prices, return of capital employed, cash flow, the level of market shares, and other factors which are causing or may have caused serious injury, or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union industry.
Interested parties who have submitted information pursuant to point (b) of Article 5 (8) and representatives of the country concerned may, upon written request, inspect all information obtained by the Commission in connection with the investigation, other than internal documents prepared by the Union authorities or authorities of the Member States, provided that such information is relevant to the presentation of their case, is not confidential within the meaning of Article 12, and is used by the Commission in the investigation.
Interested parties may also communicate their views on such information.
Where there is sufficient prima facie evidence in support of those views, the Commission shall take them into consideration.
The Commission shall ensure that all data and statistics which are used for the investigation are representative, available, comprehensible, transparent and verifiable.
As soon as the necessary technical framework is in place, the Commission shall ensure password-protected online access to the non-confidential file (the 'online platform'), which it shall manage and through which all information which is relevant and is not confidential within the meaning of Article 12 shall be disseminated.
Interested parties, Member States and the European Parliament shall be granted access to the online platform.
The Commission shall hear interested parties, in particular where they have made a written application within the period laid down in the notice of initiation published in the Official Journal of the European Union demonstrating that they are likely to be affected by the outcome of the investigation and that there are special reasons for them to be heard orally.
The Commission shall hear interested parties on further occasions if there are special reasons therefor.
The Commission shall facilitate access to the investigation for diverse and fragmented industry sectors, which are largely composed of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), through a dedicated SME Helpdesk, for example by raising awareness, by providing general information and explanations on procedures and on how to submit a request, by releasing standard questionnaires in all official languages of the Union and by replying to general, non-case-specific queries.
The SME Helpdesk shall make available standard forms for statistics to be submitted for standing purposes and questionnaires.
Where information is not supplied within the time limits set by the Commission, or where the investigation is significantly impeded, the Commission may reach a decision on the basis of the available facts.
Where the Commission finds that any interested party or any third party has supplied it with false or misleading information, it shall disregard that information and may make use of the facts available.
The Commission shall have in place the office of the Hearing Officer whose powers and responsibilities are set out in a mandate adopted by the Commission and who shall safeguard the effective exercise of the procedural rights of the interested parties.
The Commission shall notify the country or countries concerned in writing of the initiation of an investigation.

Implementation of EFSD guarantee agreements
The Commission, on behalf of the Union, shall conclude EFSD guarantee agreements with the eligible counterparts selected pursuant to Article 11 and paragraph 4 of this Article on the granting of the EFSD Guarantee, which shall be unconditional, irrevocable, at first demand, and in favour of the selected eligible counterpart.
One or more EFSD guarantee agreements shall be concluded for each investment window between the Commission and the eligible counterpart or eligible counterparts selected.
In order to address specific needs, the EFSD Guarantee may be granted for individual financing or investment operations.
Agreements may be concluded with a consortium of two or more eligible counterparts.
All EFSD guarantee agreements shall, upon request, be made available to the European Parliament and to the Council, taking into account the protection of confidential and commercially sensitive information.
EFSD guarantee agreements shall contain, in particular, provisions concerning the following:
detailed rules on the provision of the EFSD Guarantee, including its arrangements on the coverage and its defined coverage of portfolios and of projects of specific types of instruments, as well as a risk analysis of projects and project portfolios, including at sectoral, regional and national levels;
the objectives and purpose of this Regulation, a needs assessment and an indication of the expected results, taking into account the promotion of corporate social responsibility and responsible business conduct, including, in particular, by respect for the internationally agreed guidelines, principles and legal instruments referred to in point (i) of Article 9 (2);
the remuneration of the guarantee, which is to reflect the risk level, and the possibility for the remuneration to be partly subsidised in order to give more concessional terms in duly justified cases, in particular in the countries referred to in point (d) of Article 9 (2);
requirements for the use of the EFSD Guarantee, including payment conditions, such as specific time frames, interest to be paid on due amounts, expenses and recovery costs and possibly necessary liquidity arrangements;
claims procedures, including, but not limited to, triggering events and waiting periods, and procedures regarding the recovery of claims;
the monitoring, reporting and evaluation obligations pursuant to Articles 16 and 17;
clear and accessible complaints procedures for third parties that could be affected by the implementation of projects supported by the EFSD Guarantee.
The Commission, when concluding EFSD guarantee agreements with eligible counterparts, shall take due account of:
the advice and guidance of the strategic and regional operational boards, in accordance with Articles 5 and 6;
the objectives of the investment window;
the experience and operational, financial and risk management capacity of the eligible counterpart;
the amount of own resources, as well as private sector co-financing, that the eligible counterpart is ready to mobilise for the investment window.
The eligible counterpart shall approve financing and investment operations following its own rules and procedures and in compliance with the terms of the EFSD guarantee agreement.
The EFSD Guarantee may cover:
for debt instruments, the principal and all interests and amounts due to the selected eligible counterpart, but not received by it in accordance with the terms of the financing operations after an event of default has occurred;
for equity investments, the amounts invested and their associated financing costs;
for other financing and investment operations referred to in Article 9 (2), the amounts used and their associated funding costs;
all relevant expenses and recovery costs related to an event of default, unless deducted from recovery proceeds.
EFSD guarantee agreements shall lay down detailed rules on the cover, requirements, eligibility, eligible counterparts, and procedures.
The Union may support the efforts of Member States, upon their request, to improve their administrative capacity to implement Union law.
The Structural Reform Support Programme ('the Programme') was established with the objective of strengthening the capacity of Member States to prepare and implement administrative and growth-sustaining structural reforms of interest to the Union, including through the provision of assistance for the efficient and effective use of the Union funds.
Support under the Programme is provided by the Commission at the request of a Member State, and can cover a wide range of policy areas.
Developing resilient economies and a resilient society built on strong economic, social and territorial structures, which allow Member States to efficiently absorb shocks and swiftly recover from them, contributes to economic and social cohesion and unlocks growth potential.
Member States should encourage, in accordance with their legal framework, suitable contributions and involvement of national and regional public administration and stakeholders.
The implementation of institutional, administrative and growth-sustaining structural reforms, which are important for Member States, and the ownership on the ground of structural reforms of interest to the Union are important tools for achieving such developments.
Effective communication of the Programme's actions and activities and of their results at Union, national and regional levels, as appropriate, is essential for raising awareness of the achievements of the Programme, for ensuring visibility and for providing information on its effects on the ground.
Given that demand for support could exceed the Programme's funding, the requests should be prioritised, where appropriate, by the Member State concerned during the request for support procedure.
In that context, attention should be paid to requests for support that have links to the European Semester and to policy areas related to cohesion, innovation, employment, and smart and sustainable growth.
The Programme should complement other instruments in order to avoid overlaps.
Given that the Programme does not provide funding to Member States, but only technical support, it does not aim to replace or substitute funding from national budgets.
Member States have increasingly taken up support under the Programme, beyond the initial expectations.
Based on their estimated value, the requests for support received by the Commission during the 2017 cycle have significantly exceeded the available annual allocation.
During the 2018 cycle, the estimated value of requests received was five times the financial resources available for that year.
Almost all Member States have requested support under the Programme, and the requests have been distributed across all policy areas covered by the Programme.
Strengthening economic and social cohesion through structural reforms, which benefit the Union and are in accordance with Union principles and values, is crucial to underpin economic resilience as well as successful participation and enhanced real convergence in the Economic and Monetary Union, ensuring the Union's long-term stability and prosperity.
That is equally important for Member States whose currency is not the euro, in their preparation to join the euro area, and for euro-area Member States.
It is thus appropriate to stress in the general objective of the Programme, within its contribution towards responding to economic and social challenges, that enhancing economic and social cohesion, competitiveness, productivity, sustainable growth, job creation, investment and social inclusion could also contribute to the preparations for future participation in the euro area by those Member States whose currency is not the euro.
With a view to pursuing the general and specific objectives and within the eligible actions to be financed by the Programme, it should be indicated that actions and activities of the Programme should also be able to support reforms that may help Member States in their preparation to join the euro area, while respecting the principle of equal treatment of all Member States.
In order to meet the growing demand for support from Member States, and in view of the need to support the implementation of structural reforms of interest to the Union, including in Member States whose currency is not the euro, in their preparation to join the euro area, the financial allocation for the Programme should be increased to a sufficient level that allows the Union to provide support, which meets the needs of the requesting Member States and which is used in accordance with sound financial management.
That increase should not adversely affect the other priorities of cohesion policy.
Moreover, Member States should not be obliged to transfer their national and regional allocations from European Structural and Investment Funds.
In order to provide quality support with the least possible delay, the Commission should be able to use part of the financial envelope also to cover the cost of activities supporting the Programme, such as expenses related to quality control and monitoring, and evaluation of projects on the ground.
Those activities are important to ensure the efficiency of project implementation.
Regulation (EU) 2017/825 of the European Parliament and of the Council should therefore be amended accordingly.
In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,
Union economic operators have, through public consultations, expressed their interest in the responsible sourcing of minerals and reported on current due diligence schemes designed to pursue their corporate social responsibility objectives, customer requests, or the security of their supplies.
However, Union economic operators have also reported countless difficulties and practical challenges in the exercise of supply chain due diligence because of lengthy and complex global supply chains involving a high number of economic operators that are often insufficiently aware or ethically unconcerned.
The Commission should review the cost of responsible sourcing and of third-party auditing, the administrative consequences of such sourcing and auditing and their potential impact on competitiveness, in particular that of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and should report its findings to the European Parliament and to the Council.
The Commission should ensure that micro, small and medium-sized enterprises benefit from adequate technical assistance and should facilitate the exchange of information in order to implement this Regulation.
Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises established in the Union which import minerals and metals should therefore benefit from the COSME programme established by Regulation (EU) No 1287/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council [4].
Smelters and refiners are an important stage in global mineral supply chains as they are typically the last stage in which due diligence can effectively be assured by collecting, disclosing and verifying information on the mineral's origin and chain of custody.
After this stage of transformation, it is often considered to be unfeasible to trace back the origins of minerals.
The same applies to recycled metals, which have undergone even further steps in the transformation process.
A Union list of global responsible smelters and refiners could therefore provide transparency and certainty to downstream economic operators as regards supply chain due diligence practices.
In accordance with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance, upstream economic operators such as smelters and refiners should undergo an independent third-party audit of their supply chain due diligence practices, with a view to also being included in the list of global responsible smelters and refiners.
It is essential that Union importers of minerals and metals who fall within the scope of this Regulation comply with its provisions, including Union smelters and refiners which import and process minerals and concentrates thereof.
To ensure the proper functioning of the Union system while guaranteeing that the vast majority of minerals and metals falling within the scope of this Regulation and imported into the Union are subject to its requirements, this Regulation should not apply in situations where the Union importers' annual import volumes of each mineral or metal concerned are below the volume thresholds listed in Annex I to this Regulation.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the Union system and to facilitate the assessment of due diligence schemes that might be recognised under this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending Annex I to this Regulation by establishing and amending the volume thresholds of minerals and metals and in respect of setting out the methodology and criteria to be followed for that assessment acknowledging, in this regard, the work of the OECD.
It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making [5].
In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.
Member State competent authorities should be responsible for ensuring the uniform compliance of Union importers of minerals or metals who fall within the scope of this Regulation by carrying out appropriate ex-post checks.
Records of such checks should be kept for at least five years.
Member States should be required to establish the rules applicable to infringements of this Regulation.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.
The implementing powers relating to the recognition of due diligence schemes as equivalent, the withdrawal of equivalence in the case of deficiencies, as well as the establishment of the list of global responsible smelters and refiners should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council [6].
In view of the nature of those implementing acts, given the limited discretionary powers of the Commission, whereby those acts should be based on the methodology and criteria to be adopted by means of a delegated act for the recognition of due diligence schemes by the Commission, the advisory procedure is considered to be the appropriate procedure for the adoption of those implementing acts.
In order to guarantee the efficient implementation of this Regulation, provision should be made for a transitional period to allow for, inter alia, the establishment of Member States' competent authorities, for the Commission to recognise due diligence schemes and for economic operators to become familiar with their obligations under this Regulation.
The Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy should regularly review their financial assistance to and political commitments with regard to conflict-affected and high-risk areas where tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold are mined, in particular in the African Great Lakes Region, in order to ensure policy coherence, and in order to incentivise and strengthen the respect for good governance, the rule of law and ethical mining.
The Commission should report regularly to the European Parliament and to the Council on the effects of the Union system laid down by this Regulation.
By 1 January 2023 and every three years thereafter, the Commission should review the functioning and the effectiveness of the Union system, and its impact on the ground as regards the promotion of responsible sourcing of the minerals falling within the scope of this Regulation from conflict-affected and high-risk areas and on Union economic operators including SMEs, and should report to the European Parliament and to the Council.
Those reports may be accompanied, if necessary, by appropriate legislative proposals, which may include further mandatory measures.
In their Joint Communication of 5 March 2014 entitled 'Responsible sourcing of minerals originating in conflict-affected and high-risk areas: Towards an integrated EU approach' (the 'Joint Communication of 5 March 2014'), the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy committed to the implementation of accompanying measures leading to an integrated Union approach to responsible sourcing in parallel with this Regulation, with the aim not only of reaching a high level of participation by economic operators in the Union system provided for in this Regulation but also ensuring that a global, coherent and comprehensive approach is taken to promote responsible sourcing from conflict-affected and high-risk areas.
Preventing the profits from the trade in minerals and metals being used to fund armed conflict through due diligence and transparency will promote good governance and sustainable economic development.
Therefore, this Regulation incidentally covers areas falling within the Union policy in the field of development cooperation in addition to the predominant area covered which falls under the common commercial policy of the Union,

Institutions shall calculate the amount by which the amount referred to in point (a) exceeds the amount referred to in point (b) separately for their exposures which are subject to risk weighting in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three and for their exposures which are subject to risk weighting in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title II of Part Three:
the sum of the 12-month expected credit losses determined in accordance with paragraph 5.5.5 of the Annex relating to IFRS 9 and the amount of the loss allowance for lifetime expected credit losses determined in accordance with paragraph 5.5.3 of the Annex relating to IFRS 9 excluding the loss allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for financial assets that are credit-impaired as defined in Appendix A to the Annex relating to IFRS 9 as of the reporting date;
the sum of the 12-month expected credit losses determined in accordance with paragraph 5.5.5 of the Annex relating to IFRS 9 and the amount of the loss allowance for lifetime expected credit losses determined in accordance with paragraph 5.5.3 of the Annex relating to IFRS 9 excluding the loss allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for financial assets that are credit-impaired as defined in Appendix A to the Annex relating to IFRS 9 as of 1 January 2018 or on the date of initial application of IFRS 9.
For exposures which are subject to risk weighting in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three, where the amount specified in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 3 exceeds the amount specified in point (b) of paragraph 3, institutions shall set A4,SA as equal to the difference between those amounts, otherwise they shall set A4,SA as equal to zero.
For exposures which are subject to risk weighting in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title II of Part Three, where the amount specified in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 3, after applying point (b) of paragraph 5, exceeds the amount for these exposures as specified in point (b) of paragraph 3, after applying point (c) of paragraph 5, institutions shall set A4,IRB as equal to the difference between those amounts, otherwise they shall set A4,IRB as equal to zero.
For exposures which are subject to risk weighting in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title II of Part Three, institutions shall apply paragraphs 2 to 4 as follows:
for the calculation of A2,IRB institutions shall reduce each of the amounts calculated in accordance with points (b) (i) and (ii) of paragraph 2 of this Article by the sum of expected loss amounts calculated in accordance with Article 158 (5), (6) and (10) as of 31 December 2017 or the day before the date of initial application of IFRS 9.
Where for the amount referred to in point (b) (i) of paragraph 2 of this Article the calculation results in a negative number, the institution shall set the value of that amount as equal to zero.
Where for the amount referred to in point (b) (ii) of paragraph 2 of this Article the calculation results in a negative number, the institution shall set the value of that amount as equal to zero;
institutions shall replace the amount calculated in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 3 of this Article by the sum of the 12-month expected credit losses determined in accordance with paragraph 5.5.5 of the Annex relating to IFRS 9 and the amount of the loss allowance for lifetime expected credit losses determined in accordance with paragraph 5.5.3 of the Annex relating to IFRS 9 excluding the loss allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for financial assets that are credit-impaired, as defined in Appendix A to the Annex relating to IFRS 9, reduced by the sum of related expected loss amounts for the same exposures calculated in accordance with Article 158 (5), (6) and (10) as of the reporting date.
Where the calculation results in a negative number, the institution shall set the value of the amount referred to in point (a) of paragraph 3 of this Article as equal to zero;

This Regulation is without prejudice to establishing whether or not any WTO Member is a market economy or to the terms and conditions set out in protocols and other instruments in accordance with which countries have acceded to the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization done on 15 April 1994 [4].
In light of experience gained in past proceedings, it is appropriate to clarify the circumstances in which significant distortions affecting to a considerable extent free market forces may be deemed to exist.
In particular, it is appropriate to clarify that this is the case when reported prices or costs, including the costs of raw materials and energy, are not the result of free market forces because they are affected by substantial government intervention.
It is further appropriate to clarify that when assessing the existence of significant distortions regard should be had, inter alia, to the potential impact of one or more of the following elements: the market in question being to a significant extent served by enterprises which operate under the ownership, control or policy supervision or guidance of the authorities of the exporting country; state presence in firms allowing the state to interfere with respect to prices or costs; public policies or measures discriminating in favour of domestic suppliers or otherwise influencing free market forces; the lack, discriminatory application or inadequate enforcement of bankruptcy, corporate or property laws; wage costs being distorted; access to finance granted by institutions which implement public policy objectives or otherwise not acting independently of the state.
The Commission should produce, make public and regularly update reports on significant distortions, which could potentially result in an anti-dumping investigation, describing the market circumstances concerning those instances in a certain country or a certain sector.
Such reports and the evidence on which they are based should be placed on the file of any investigation relating to that country or sector.
In such investigations, interested parties should have ample opportunity to comment on the reports and the evidence on which they are based.
When assessing the existence of significant distortions, relevant international standards, including core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and relevant multilateral environmental conventions, should be taken into account, where appropriate.
Costs are normally calculated on the basis of records kept by the exporter and producer under investigation.
However, where there are direct or indirect significant distortions in the exporting country with the consequence that costs reflected in the records of the party concerned are artificially low, such costs may be adjusted or established on any reasonable basis, including information from other representative markets or from international prices or benchmarks.
Domestic costs may also be used, but only to the extent that they are positively established not to be distorted, on the basis of accurate and appropriate evidence.
When data are sourced in representative countries and the Commission has to establish whether the level of social and environmental protection in such countries is adequate, it is necessary for the Commission to examine whether those countries comply with core ILO and relevant multilateral environmental conventions.
Where part of the costs for an exporter and producer is distorted, including where a given input is sourced from different sources, that part of the costs should be replaced by undistorted costs.
In light of experience gained in past proceedings, it is appropriate to further clarify that, for the purposes of determining the existence of significant distortions in a third country, due account should be taken of all relevant evidence regarding the circumstances prevailing on the domestic market of the exporters and producers from that country, which has been placed on the file, and upon which interested parties have had an opportunity to comment, including an opportunity for those exporters and producers to conclusively show that their domestic costs are undistorted.
Where available, such evidence includes relevant reports.
Indications as to the existence of significant distortions may also be presented by all relevant stakeholders, including Union industry and trade unions.
Such indications and the need to avoid any additional burdens for Union industry in using the anti-dumping instrument, in particular in view of the economic and trade specificities of small and medium-sized enterprises, should be considered when deciding on preparing or updating the relevant reports.
With respect to the methodology used in the original investigation and to be used in the review investigation, Article 11 (9) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 applies.
In that context, it is appropriate to clarify that, when examining whether there is an indication that circumstances have changed, due account should be taken of all relevant evidence, including relevant reports regarding the circumstances prevailing on the domestic market of the exporters and producers and the evidence on which they are based, which has been placed on the file, and upon which interested parties have had an opportunity to comment.
In the absence of any other specific transitional rules regulating the matter, it is appropriate to provide for the application of this Regulation to all decisions on the initiation of proceedings, and to all proceedings, including original investigations and review investigations, initiated on or after 20 December 2017, subject to Article 11 (9) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1036.
Furthermore, by way of specific transitional rule for existing measures, and having regard to the absence of any other specific transitional rules regulating the matter, in the case of a transition from a normal value calculated pursuant to Article 2 (7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 to a normal value calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 as amended by this Regulation, the original methodology should continue to apply until the initiation of the first expiry review following such transition.
With a view to reducing the risk of circumvention of the provisions of this Regulation, the same approach should apply with respect to reviews conducted pursuant to Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1036.
It is also appropriate to recall that a transition from a normal value calculated pursuant to Article 2 (7) to a normal value calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 as amended by this Regulation would not in itself constitute sufficient evidence within the meaning of Article 11 (3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1036.
Such transitional rules should fill a lacuna that would otherwise risk generating legal uncertainty, provide a reasonable opportunity for interested parties to adapt themselves to the expiry of the old rules and the entry into force of the new rules, and facilitate the efficient, orderly and equitable administration of Regulation (EU) 2016/1036.
By Regulation (EU) 2016/1037 [5], the European Parliament and the Council adopted common rules for protection against subsidised imports from countries that are not Member States of the Union.
Experience has shown that the actual magnitude of subsidisation is usually discovered during the relevant investigation.
In particular, investigated exporters are frequently found to benefit from subsidies whose existence could not have been reasonably known before carrying out the investigation.
It is appropriate to clarify that, when such subsidies are found in the course of any given investigation or review, the Commission should offer additional consultations to the country of origin and/or export concerned with regard to such subsidies identified in the course of the investigation.
In the absence of specific transitional rules regulating the matter, it is appropriate to provide for the application of this Regulation to all decisions on the initiation of proceedings, and to all proceedings, including original investigations and review investigations, initiated on or after 20 December 2017.
Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 and Regulation (EU) 2016/1037 should therefore be amended accordingly,
In addition, Georgia benefits from the Neighbourhood Investment Facility which contributed approximatly EUR 86 million to projects in Georgia during the period of 2008-2017.
Given that Georgia is a country covered by the ENP, it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union.
The Union's macro-financial assistance should be an exceptional financial instrument of untied and undesignated balance-of-payments support, which aims at addressing the beneficiary's immediate external financing needs and should underpin the implementation of a policy programme containing strong immediate adjustment and structural reform measures designed to improve the balance-of-payments position in the short term.
Given that there is still a significant residual external financing gap in Georgia's balance of payments over and above the resources provided by the IMF and other multilateral institutions, the Union's macro-financial assistance assistance to Georgia is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Georgia's request to support its economic stabilisation, in conjunction with the IMF programme.
The Union's macro-financial assistance would support the economic stabilisation and the structural reform agenda of Georgia, supplementing resources made available under the IMF's financial arrangement.
The Union's macro-financial assistance should aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external financing situation for Georgia thereby supporting its economic and social development.
The determination of the amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance is based on a complete quantitative assessment of Georgia's residual external financing needs, and takes into account its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, in particular the international reserves at its disposal.
The Union's macro-financial assistance should complement the programmes and resources provided by the IMF and the World Bank.
The determination of the amount of the assistance also takes into account expected financial contributions from bilateral and multilateral donors and the need to ensure fair burden sharing between the Union and other donors, as well as the pre-existing deployment of the Union's other external financing instruments in Georgia and the added value of the overall Union involvement.
Taking into consideration Georgia's residual external financing needs, the level of its economic and social development as measured by per capita income and the incidence of poverty, as well as its level of indebtedness, a part of the assistance should be provided in the form of grants.
The Commission should ensure that the Union's macro-financial assistance is legally and substantially in line with the key principles for external action enshrined in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union and the objectives of, and measures taken within, the different areas of external action and other relevant Union policies.
The Union's macro-financial assistance should support the Union's external policy towards Georgia.
Commission services and the European External Action Service should work closely together throughout the macro-financial assistance operation in order to coordinate, and ensure the consistency of, Union external policy.
The Union's macro-financial assistance should support Georgia's commitment to values shared with the Union, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights, sustainable development and poverty reduction, as well as its commitment to the principles of open, rule-based and fair trade.
A pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance should be that Georgia respects effective democratic mechanisms - including a multi-party parliamentary system - and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights.
In addition, the specific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance management systems in Georgia, and promote structural reforms aimed at supporting sustainable and inclusive growth, employment creation and fiscal consolidation.
The Union's macro-financial assistance to Georgia should also include measures to support the implementation of the Association Agreement, including the DCFTA.
To ensure that specific objectives can be properly assessed, they need to be set out in a verifiable and measurable manner.
Both the fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the European External Action Service.
If the precondition and the objectives are not met or if the aims and principles of the Association Agreement are generally disregarded, the Commission should temporarily suspend or cancel the disbursement of the Union's macro-financial assistance.
In order to ensure that the Union's financial interests linked to the Union's macro-financial assistance are protected efficiently, Georgia should take appropriate measures relating to the prevention of, and fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to the Union's macro-financial assistance.
In addition, provision should be made for the Commission to carry out checks and for the Court of Auditors to carry out audits.
Release of the Union's macro-financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the European Parliament and of the Council, as budgetary authority.
The amounts of macro-financial assistance provided in the form of grants and the amounts of the provision required for macro-financial assistance in the form of loans should be consistent with the budgetary appropriations provided for in the multiannual financial framework.
The Union's macro-financial assistance should be managed by the Commission.
In order to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council are able to follow the implementation of this Decision, the Commission should regularly inform them of developments relating to the assistance and provide them with the relevant documents.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.
The Union's macro-financial assistance should be subject to economic policy conditions, to be laid down in a Memorandum of Understanding.
In order to ensure uniform conditions of implementation and for reasons of efficiency, the Commission should be empowered to negotiate such conditions with the Georgian authorities under the supervision of the committee of representatives of the Member States in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.
Under that Regulation, the advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as provided for in that Regulation.
Considering the potentially important impact of assistance of more than EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used for operations above that threshold.
Considering the amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance to Georgia, the advisory procedure should apply to the adoption of the Memorandum of Understanding, and to any reduction, suspension or cancellation of the assistance,

Those values should be indicated in the relevant stock advice and, where appropriate, in any other publicly-available scientific advice, including, for example, in mixed fisheries advice issued by ICES.
Council Regulations (EC) No 676/2007 and (EC) No 1342/2008 set out the rules for the sustainable exploitation of the stocks of cod, plaice and sole in the North Sea and its adjacent waters.
Those and other demersal stocks are taken in mixed fisheries.
Therefore, it is appropriate to establish a single multiannual plan taking into account such technical interactions.
In addition, such a multiannual plan should apply to demersal stocks and their fisheries in the North Sea.
Those are roundfish, flatfish and cartilaginous fish species, Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and Northern prawn (Pandalus borealis) that live at or near the bottom of the water column.
Some demersal stocks are exploited both in the North Sea and in its adjacent waters.
Therefore the scope of the provisions of the plan relating to targets and safeguards for stocks that are mainly exploited in the North Sea should be extended so that they also cover those areas outside the North Sea.
In addition, for stocks which are present in the North Sea, but which are mainly exploited outside the North Sea, it is necessary to establish the targets and safeguards in multiannual plans for areas outside the North Sea where those stocks are mainly exploited, extending the scope of those multiannual plans so that they also cover the North Sea.
The geographical scope of the plan should be based on the geographical distribution of stocks indicated in the latest scientific stock advice provided by ICES.
Future changes to the geographical distribution of stocks as set out in the plan may be needed either due to improved scientific information or due to migration of stocks.
Therefore, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts adjusting the geographical distribution of stocks set out in the plan if the scientific advice provided by ICES indicates a change in the geographical distribution of the relevant stocks.
Where stocks of common interest are also exploited by third countries, the Union should engage with those third countries with a view to ensuring that those stocks are managed in a sustainable manner that is consistent with the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, in particular Article 2 (2) thereof, and of this Regulation.
Where no formal agreement is reached, the Union should make every effort to reach common arrangements for fishing of such stocks with a view to making sustainable management possible, thereby promoting a level-playing field for Union operators.
The objective of the plan should be to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, and in particular to reaching and maintaining MSY for the target stocks implementing the landing obligation for demersal stocks subject to catch limits, to promoting a fair standard of living for those who depend on fishing activities, bearing in mind coastal fisheries and socioeconomic aspects, and to implementing the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management.
The plan should also specify details for the implementation of the landing obligation in Union waters of the North Sea for all stocks of species to which the landing obligation applies under Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
Article 16 (4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 requires that fishing opportunities be fixed in accordance with the objectives set out in Article 2 (2) thereof and comply with the targets, time frames and margins established in the multiannual plans.
It is appropriate to establish the target fishing mortality ('F') that corresponds to the objective of reaching and maintaining MSY as ranges of values which are consistent with achieving MSY (FMSY).
Those ranges, based on the best available scientific advice, are necessary in order to provide the flexibility to take account of developments in scientific advice, to contribute to the implementation of the landing obligation and to take into account the characteristics of mixed fisheries.
The ranges of FMSY should be calculated and provided by ICES, in particular in its periodic catch advice.
Based on the plan, they are derived to deliver no more than a 5% reduction in long-term yield compared to MSY, as set out in ICES' response to the EU request to ICES to provide ranges of FMSY for selected North Sea and Baltic Sea Stocks.
The upper limit of the range is capped, so that the probability of the stock falling below Blim is no more than 5%.
That upper limit also conforms to the ICES advice rule, which indicates that when the spawning biomass or abundance is in a poor state, F is to be reduced to a value that does not exceed an upper limit equal to the FMSY point value multiplied by the spawning biomass or abundance in the total allowable catch (TAC) year divided by MSY Btrigger.
ICES uses those considerations and the advice rule in its provision of scientific advice on fishing mortality and catch options.
For the purposes of fixing fishing opportunities, there should be an upper threshold for ranges of FMSY in normal use and, provided that the stock concerned is considered to be in a good state, an upper limit for certain cases.
It should be possible to fix fishing opportunities at the upper limit only if, on the basis of scientific advice or evidence, it is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation in mixed fisheries or necessary to avoid harm to a stock caused by intra- or inter-species stock dynamics, or in order to limit the year-to-year variations in fishing opportunities.
For stocks for which targets relating to MSY are available, and for the purpose of the application of safeguard measures, it is necessary to establish conservation reference points expressed as trigger spawning biomass levels for fish stocks, and trigger abundance levels for Norway lobster.
Appropriate safeguard measures should be provided for in case the stock size falls below those levels.
Safeguard measures should include the reduction of fishing opportunities and specific conservation measures when scientific advice states that remedial measures are needed.
Those measures should be supplemented by all other appropriate measures such as Commission measures in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 or Member State measures in accordance with Article 13 of that Regulation.
It should be possible to set the TAC for Norway lobster in ICES division 2a and subarea 4 as the sum of the catch limits established for each functional unit and of the statistical rectangles outside the functional units within that TAC area.
However, this should not preclude the adoption of measures to protect specific functional units.
Where the Council takes into account a significant impact of recreational fisheries in the framework of the fishing opportunities for a certain stock, it should be able to set a TAC for commercial catches which takes into account the volume of recreational catches and/or to adopt other measures restricting recreational fisheries such as bag limits and closure periods.
In order to comply with the landing obligation established by Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the plan should provide for additional management measures to be further specified in accordance with Article 18 of that Regulation.
In order to avoid the disruptive dislocation of fishing activity which could have a negative impact on the state of the cod stocks, it is appropriate to maintain the system of fishing authorisations linked to a limitation of the total capacity of fishing vessels' engine power in ICES division 7d, as previously applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008.
The deadline for submitting joint recommendations from Member States having a direct management interest should be established, as required by Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
In accordance with Article 10 (3) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, provisions should be established for the assessment by the Commission, by 6 August 2023 and every five years thereafter, of the adequacy and effectiveness of the application of this Regulation based on scientific advice.
That period allows for the full implementation of the landing obligation, and for regionalised measures to be adopted, implemented and to show effects on the stocks and fisheries.
It is also the minimum period required by scientific bodies.
In order to adapt to technical and scientific progress in a timely and proportionate manner, to ensure flexibility and to allow for the evolution of certain measures, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of supplementing this Regulation as regards adjustments concerning the stocks covered by this Regulation following changes in the geographical distribution of the stocks, remedial measures and implementation of the landing obligation.
In its communication of 26 August 2010 entitled 'A Digital Agenda for Europe', the Commission recalls that the Europe 2020 Strategy underlined the importance of broadband deployment to promote social inclusion and competitiveness in the Union and reaffirmed the goal of ensuring that, by 2020, all Europeans have access to internet speeds of above 30 Mbps and 50% or more of European households subscribe to internet connections above 100 Mbps.
Among measures to support the vision of internet connectivity across the Union, the Commission promotes, in its communication of 14 September 2016, the deployment of local wireless access points through simplified planning procedures and reduced regulatory obstacles.
Such access points, including those that are ancillary to the provision of other public services or non-commercial in character, can make an important contribution to the improvement of current wireless communication networks and to the deployment of future generations of such networks by facilitating more granular coverage in line with evolving needs.
Those access points should be able to form part of a network with a single authentication system that is valid across the whole Union and otherfree local wireless connectivity networks should be able to join the system.
That system should comply with Union data protection requirements and with Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of the European Parliament and of the Council [4].
In the context of this Regulation, local wireless connectivity that is free of charge and without discriminatory conditions means, with regard to being free of charge, that it is provided without corresponding remuneration, whether by direct payment or by other types of consideration, such as commercial advertising or the provision of personal data for commercial purposes.
With regard to being without discriminatory conditions, it means that it is provided without prejudice to restrictions required under Union law, or under national law that complies with Union law, as well as being subject to the need to ensure a smooth functioning of the network and, in particular, the need to ensure a fair allocation of capacity between users at peak times.
A competitive market, and a legislative framework which can adapt to developments and which encourages competition, investment and the widespread availability and take-up of very-high-capacity connectivity, as well as trans-European networks and new business models, are important drivers for investment in high and very-high-capacity networks that can deliver connectivity to citizens throughout the Union.
In light of the Commission's communication of 14 September 2016 and in order to promote digital inclusion, the Union should support the provision of high-quality local wireless connectivity that is free of charge and without discriminatory conditions in centres of local public life, including outdoor spaces accessible to the general public.
Such support is not covered by Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 [5] or (EU) No 283/2014 [6] of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Such support should encourage public sector bodies, as defined in Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council [7], to offer local wireless connectivity that is free of charge and without discriminatory conditions as an ancillary service to their public mission so as to ensure that people in local communities can benefit from high-speed broadband and have the opportunity to improve their digital skills in centres of public life.
Such bodies could include municipalities, associations formed by municipalities, other local public authorities and institutions, libraries and hospitals.
Local wireless connectivity that is free of charge and without discriminatory conditions could contribute to bridging the digital divide, especially in communities that lag behind in terms of digital literacy, including in rural areas and remote locations.
Improving access to high-speed and very-high-speed broadband and consequently to online services, especially in rural areas and remote locations, could increase quality of life by facilitating access to services, for example e-Health and e-Government, and could promote the development of local small and medium-sized enterprises.
To guarantee the success of the support to be provided under this Regulation and to promote Union action in this area, the Commission should ensure that the entities that pursue projects benefitting from Union financial assistance available under this Regulation provide end-users with as much information as possible on availability of the services and should draw attention to the fact that the Union has granted financing.
Such information could also provide end-users with easy access to information about the Union.
Considering its specific purpose and that it addresses local needs, the promotion of local wireless connectivity that is free of charge and without discriminatory conditions in centres of public life should be identified as a distinct project of common interest in the telecommunications sector within the meaning of Regulations (EU) No 1316/2013 and (EU) No 283/2014.
To provide appropriate financing for the promotion of internet connectivity in local communities and to ensure its successful implementation, the financial envelope for the implementation of the Connecting Europe Facility in the telecommunications sector should be increased by EUR 25000000, and may be increased to EUR 50000000.
Given the non-commercial nature of the support to be provided under this Regulation and the expected small scale of individual projects, the administrative burden should be limited to a minimum and should be proportionate to the benefits envisaged, taking into account the need for accountability and a proper balance between simplification and control.
This Regulation should therefore be implemented by the most appropriate forms of financial assistance, in particular grants, for instance by way of vouchers, available under Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council [8], now or in the future.
The support to be provided under this Regulation should not rely on financial instruments.
The principle of sound financial management should apply.
Given the limited volume of financial appropriations measured against the potentially high number of applications, administrative procedures should be simplified so that decisions can be taken in a timely manner.
Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 should be amended to allow Member States to agree to categories of proposals in line with the criteria defined in Section 4 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 283/2014 in order to avoid the individual approval of applications and ensure that certification of expenditure and annual reporting to the Commission are not obligatory for grants or other forms of financial assistance awarded under this Regulation.
Due to the limited reach of any single local wireless access point and the small value of individual projects covered, access points benefitting from financial assistance under this Regulation are not expected to challenge commercial offers.
In order to further ensure that such financial assistance does not unduly distort competition, crowd out private investments or create disincentives for private operators to invest, the support provided for under this Regulation should be limited to projects that do not duplicate already existing free private or public offers of similar characteristics in the same public space.
This Regulation should not prevent the setting of limitations in the user's terms and conditions, such as limiting connectivity to a period of time or to a reasonable maximum data consumption.
Additional support could contribute to making a more significant impact and should therefore not be excluded.
Such additional support could be provided from either public sources of funding, such as Union or national funds, including the European Regional Development Fund, or from private sources of funding.
The available budget should be allocated in a geographically balanced manner across Member States to projects and, in principle, on a 'first come, first served' basis.
The mechanism aiming to ensure geographical balance should be included in the relevant work programmes adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013, and should be further specified in calls for proposals adopted in accordance with that Regulation, if necessary, by, for example, enabling the enhanced participation of applicants from Member States where the take-up of grants or other forms of financial assistance has been comparatively low.
To ensure that connectivity in accordance with this Regulation is provided quickly, financial assistance should be implemented using to the fullest extent possible online tools that allow for the swift submission and handling of applications and support the implementation, monitoring and auditing of the local wireless access points installed.
The Commission and the relevant authorities in the Member States should promote the project of common interest.
This Regulation is without prejudice to national law that complies with Union law, such as national provisions preventing municipalities from providing wireless connectivity that is free of charge directly, while allowing them to provide such connectivity through private entities.
Given the urgent need for internet connectivity within the Union and for promoting access to networks that can deliver, throughout the Union, including in rural areas and remote locations, an internet experience of high quality based at least on high-speed broadband services, and preferably also achieving the objectives of the European Gigabit Society, financial assistance should seek to attain a geographically balanced distribution.
Beneficiary entities should be required to provide the wireless connectivity for not less than three years.
Actions financed pursuant to this Regulation should use the most recent and best available equipment, capable of delivering easy-to-access and appropriately secured high-speed connectivity that is free of charge and without discriminatory conditions to its users.
Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to support the provision of high-quality wireless connectivity in local communities across the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.
Regulations (EU) No 1316/2013 and (EU) No 283/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly,
Directive 2003/87/EC is amended as follows:
In Article 3c, the following paragraph is inserted:
Any allocation of allowances for aviation activities to and from aerodromes located in countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") after 31 December 2023 shall be subject to the review referred to in Article 28b.
In Article 3d, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
From 1 January 2013, 15% of allowances shall be auctioned.
The Commission shall undertake a study on the ability of the aviation sector to pass on the cost of CO2 to its customers, in relation to the EU ETS and to the global market-based measure developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization ("ICAO").
The study shall assess the ability of the aviation sector to pass on the cost of required emission units, comparing this to industries and to the power sector, with the intention of making a proposal to increase the percentage of auctioning pursuant to the review referred to in Article 28b (2), taking into account the analysis of costs passed on and considering alignment with other sectors and the competitiveness between different modes of transport.
In Article 3d, paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:
All revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances should be used to tackle climate change in the Union and third countries, inter alia, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to adapt to the impacts of climate change in the Union and third countries, especially developing countries, to fund research and development for mitigation and adaptation, including in particular in the fields of aeronautics and air transport, to reduce emissions through low-emission transport and to cover the cost of administering the EU ETS.
Auctioning revenues should also be used to fund common projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation sector, such as the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking and the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiatives and any initiatives enabling the widespread use of GNSS for satellite-based navigation and interoperable capabilities within all Member States, in particular projects that improve air navigation infrastructure, the provision of air navigation services and the use of airspace.
The proceeds of auctioning may also be used to fund contributions to the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, and measures to avoid deforestation.
Special consideration shall be given by Member States that use those revenues for co-financing research and innovation to programmes or initiatives under the Ninth Research Framework Programme ("FP9").
Transparency on the use of revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances under this Directive is essential to meeting Union commitments.
Member States shall inform the Commission of actions taken pursuant to the first subparagraph of this paragraph.
In Article 12, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:
For the period until 31 December 2020, Member States shall ensure that, by 30 April each year, the operator of each installation surrenders a number of allowances, other than allowances issued under Chapter II, that is equal to the total emissions from that installation during the preceding calendar year as verified in accordance with Article 15, and that those allowances are subsequently cancelled.
For the period starting from 1 January 2021, Member States shall ensure that, by 30 April each year, the operator of each installation surrenders a number of allowances, that is equal to the total emissions from that installation during the preceding calendar year as verified in accordance with Article 15, and that those allowances are subsequently cancelled, subject to the review referred to in Article 28b.
In Article 12, the following paragraph is inserted before paragraph 3a:
Where necessary, and for as long as is necessary, in order to protect the environmental integrity of the EU ETS, aircraft operators and other operators in the EU ETS shall be prohibited from using allowances that are issued by a Member State in respect of which there are obligations lapsing for aircraft operators and other operators.
The legal act referred to in Article 19 shall include the measures necessary in the cases referred to in this paragraph.
Article 28a is amended as follows:
the title is replaced by the following:
"Derogations applicable in advance of the implementation of the ICAO's global market-based measure";
paragraph 1 is amended as follows:
points (a) and (b) are replaced by the following:
all emissions from flights to and from aerodromes located in countries outside the EEA in each calendar year from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2023, subject to the review referred to in Article 28b;
all emissions from flights between an aerodrome located in an outermost region within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and an aerodrome located in another region of the EEA in each calendar year from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2023, subject to the review referred to in Article 28b.;
point (c) is deleted;
By way of derogation from Articles 3e and 3f, aircraft operators benefiting from the derogations provided for in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be issued, each year, with a number of free allowances reduced in proportion to the reduction of the surrender obligation provided for in those points.
By way of derogation from Article 3f (8), allowances that are not allocated from the special reserve shall be cancelled.
From 1 January 2021, the number of allowances allocated to aircraft operators shall be subject to the application of the linear factor referred to in Article 9, subject to the review referred to in Article 28b.
As regards activity in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2023, Member States shall, before 1 September 2018, publish the number of aviation allowances allocated to each aircraft operator.;
paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:
By way of derogation from Article 3d (3), the number of allowances to be auctioned by each Member State in respect of the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2023 shall be reduced to correspond to its share of attributed aviation emissions from flights which are not subject to the derogations provided for in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article.;
paragraph 6 is replaced by the following:
By way of derogation from Articles 3g, 12, 15 and 18a, where an aircraft operator has total annual emissions lower than 25000 tonnes of CO2, or where an aircraft operator has total annual emissions lower than 3000 tonnes of CO2 from flights other than those referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article, its emissions shall be considered to be verified emissions if determined by using the small emitters tool approved under Commission Regulation (EU) No 606/2010 and populated by Eurocontrol with data from its ETS support facility.
Member States may implement simplified procedures for non-commercial aircraft operators as long as such procedures provide no less accuracy than the small emitters tool provides.
paragraph 7 is replaced by the following:
Paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply to countries with whom an agreement pursuant to Article 25 or 25a has been reached only in line with the terms of such agreement.;
paragraph 8 is deleted.
The following Articles are inserted:
The international community faces an unprecedented migration and refugee crisis, which requires solidarity and the efficient mobilisation of financial resources and calls for the existing challenges to be confronted and surmounted in a concerted manner.
All actors need to work together to apply sustained medium- and long-term policies and make efficient use of existing programmes in order to develop and support initiatives which contribute to the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals and to addressing the political, social, economic and environmental factors that constitute the root causes of migration, including, but not limited to, poverty, inequality, demographic growth, lack of employment, limited access to education and economic opportunities, instability, conflict, climate change and the long-term consequences of forced displacement.
While providing resources to address the root causes of migration is of paramount importance, the Union remains fully committed to policies in other areas of key strategic priority as outlined in the Global Strategy for the European Union's Foreign and Security Policy.
A new results-oriented partnership framework with third countries which takes account of all Union policies and instruments has been developed.
As part of that new partnership framework, the Union's External Investment Plan has been established in order to support investments in regions outside the Union while contributing to the achievement of the UN sustainable development goals and addressing the root causes of migration.
It should also contribute to fulfilling the objectives of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and of the Paris Agreement adopted under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (the 'Paris Agreement'), as well as the objectives pursued by other financing instruments for external action.
On 28 June 2016, the European Council endorsed the proposal of the European Investment Bank (EIB) to contribute to the External Investment Plan through the EIB Resilience Initiative, which is designed to foster investments in the Southern Neighbourhood and Western Balkans.
A key component of the EIB Resilience Initiative is the expansion, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, of the EIB External Lending Mandate.
This should enable the EIB to rapidly contribute to the objectives of the External Investment Plan, in particular by providing additional financing to private-sector beneficiaries, with a view to crowding in private investments and boosting long-term investment.
The Strategic Board of the European Fund for Sustainable Development, where the EIB is represented, will provide guidance on complementarity between the EIB Resilience Initiative and the components of the External Investment Plan in line with its rules of procedure and without prejudice to the EIB's internal governance rules.
A budgetary guarantee for financing operations carried out outside the Union (the 'EU guarantee') was granted to the EIB by means of Decision No 466/2014/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council.
In accordance with Decision No 466/2014/EU, the Commission, in cooperation with the EIB, prepared a mid-term review report evaluating the application of that Decision on the basis of an independent external evaluation.
The long-term economic resilience of refugees, migrants, host and transit communities, and communities of origin as a strategic response to addressing root causes of migration should be added as a new objective supported by the EU guarantee (the 'new objective').
Operations supported under the new objective should be distinct from Union efforts in the area of border control.
In order to allow the External Lending Mandate to respond to potential upcoming challenges and Union priorities, as well as to fulfil the new objective, the maximum ceiling for the EIB financing operations under the EU guarantee should be increased to EUR 32300000000.
Under the general mandate, EUR 1400000000 should be earmarked for projects in the public sector directed towards fulfilling the new objective.
Under a new private-sector lending mandate, a maximum amount of EUR 2300000000 should be dedicated to projects directed towards fulfilling the new objective within the maximum increased ceiling and should benefit from the Comprehensive Guarantee by the Union.
The success of one of the EIB's main objectives under the External Lending Mandate, namely support for local private-sector development, in particular support to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), hinges on factors such as SMEs' access to finance, credit and technical assistance, on the promotion of entrepreneurship and on efforts to stimulate the transition from the volatile informal economy to the formal sector.
In that context, the EIB financing operations should seek to support small investment projects run by SMEs, as well as investment projects in remote rural areas and in the fields of drinking-water treatment, wastewater disposal and renewable energy.
Complementarity and coordination with Union initiatives addressing root causes of migration should be ensured, including through Union support for the sustainable reintegration of returned migrants in the countries of origin.
Following the Paris Agreement, the EIB should endeavour to sustain a high level of climate-relevant operations, the volume of which should represent at least 25% of the total EIB financing operations outside the Union.
EIB financing operations covered by Decision No 466/2014/EU should be consistent with reaching the target of at least 35% of total EIB financing operations in emerging economies and developing countries outside the Union by 2020.
The EIB should take into account the European Council conclusions of 22 May 2013 on phasing out environmentally or economically harmful subsidies, including those for fossil fuels.
The risk to the general budget of the Union associated with EIB financing operations under the private-sector lending mandate should be priced.
The revenues generated from such risk pricing should be paid into the Guarantee Fund for external actions established by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 in order to cover the commercial risk and to avoid market distortions.
The EIB should develop and implement a set of indicators in its Results Measurement framework for projects directed towards fulfilling the new objective.
Therefore, an assessment of the contribution of EIB financing operations towards the new objective, including, where applicable, the contribution to the UN sustainable development goals, the involvement of local civil society, and alignment with Union external policy priorities and budget priorities, should be included in the Commission's annual reporting to the European Parliament and to the Council on EIB financing operations.
The visibility and transparency of EIB financing operations covered by Decision No 466/2014/EU, in particular with regard to projects financed through financial intermediaries, should be ensured by improving access to information for the Union's institutions and for the general public, taking into account the need to protect confidential and commercially sensitive information.
The relevant Union policy on non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes is laid down in the legal acts of the Union and in Council conclusions, in particular in the Annex to those of 8 November 2016, and any subsequent updates.
Due diligence on EIB financing operations covered by Decision No 466/2014/EU should include a thorough check of compliance with applicable Union legislation and agreed international and Union standards on anti-money laundering, the fight against the terrorism financing, tax fraud and tax avoidance.
Moreover, in the context of the External Lending Mandate reporting, the EIB should provide information, on a country-by-country basis, on the compliance of EIB financing operations with its policy on non-cooperative jurisdictions and the list of intermediaries with which the EIB cooperates.
On 12 October 2016, the EIB approved the implementation of the EIB Resilience Initiative.
It should be possible for projects under the EIB Resilience Initiative which were approved after that date and before the entry into force of this Decision and the conclusion of the guarantee agreement to be covered by the EU guarantee, subject to confirmation by the Commission that they are in line with the new objective and respect the terms of the guarantee agreement.
EIB financing operations with corporates should only benefit from the private-sector comprehensive guarantee if they promote inclusive growth and enhanced job creation and are not adequately served by local financial markets.
EIB financing operations should be consistent with the principles set out in the Commission communication of 25 October 2011 entitled 'A renewed EU strategy 2011-14 for Corporate Social Responsibility', including with regard to financial intermediaries.
Where the Union external policy priorities change, or in cases of urgency and crisis situations that could arise within the mandate period, and in accordance with relevant European Parliament resolutions and Council decisions and conclusions, the ceiling for reallocation between the regions by the EIB in the course of the mandate should be increased from 10% to 20%.
The Commission should regularly inform the European Parliament and the Council of such reallocations.
Given the importance of the EIB Resilience Initiative in the Union strategy to address the root causes of migration and the needs of transit and host communities, it remains of the utmost importance that the amounts earmarked under the External Lending Mandate ceilings for projects directed to the new objective be absorbed completely.
Nevertheless, if due to unforeseen circumstances the earmarked amounts cannot be absorbed completely, some increased flexibility should also be allowed.
Therefore, if by 30 June 2019 the EIB concludes that it is not in a position to absorb its forecasted target under the EIB Resilience Initiative, it should be possible for up to 20% of the EUR 1400000000 under the general mandate earmarked for public-sector projects and of the EUR 2300000000 under the private-sector lending mandate to be reallocated within and/or between pre-accession countries and beneficiaries and Neighbourhood and Partnership countries.
Any such reallocation should be subject to prior agreement between the Commission and the EIB.
The lists of eligible regions and countries and potentially eligible regions and countries should be modified in order to exclude high-income regions and countries with high credit ratings, namely Brunei, Chile, Iceland, Israel, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.
In addition, Iran should be added to the list of potentially eligible regions and countries.
Decision No 466/2014/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,
