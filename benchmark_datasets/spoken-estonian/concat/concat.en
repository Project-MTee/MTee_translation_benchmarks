Good afternoon, dear journalists, everyone interested and those watching us online here at the Tallinn Presentation and Press Centre.
It is the sixteenth of December.
The Tallinn City Government has held its regular session and today Mihhail Kõlvart, the mayor, is in front of you at the press conference held by the city government, Kirsti Ruul, Director of Communications of the City as of 1 January, twenty twenty-one, our well-known Irina Donchenko, Adviser of the Epidemic Control Department of the Health Board, and Kaisa Kamm, Head of Direct Assistance to the Estonian Society for the Protection of Animals.
And we have already heard and read today the news that five hundred and ninety persons have tested  positive for the coronavirus and therefore, Irina Donchenko, Adviser of the Epidemic Control Department of the Health Board, is the first to start today.
Hello from the Health Board.
Indeed, today's number is five hundred and ninety, so what does that mean for us?
This means that the intensity of the morbidity is still very high throughout Estonia.
And if we look at these five hundred and ninety cases, they accounted for ten percent of the total number of tests performed, and most cases were registered in Harju County, i.e. sixty percent, in Ida-Viru County fourteen percent, and in Tartu County, eight percent.
The incidence per hundred thousand inhabitants in the last fourteen days was four hundred and seventy point sixty-six today, and it remains the highest.
If we look at the counties, it is the highest in Ida-Viru County - one thousand fifty-three, in Harju County - five hundred and fifty-eight, in Rapla County - three hundred and seventy-eight, in Hiiu County - three hundred and eleven, in Võru County - three hundred and seven and in Tartu County - three hundred.
This is the so-called top five or six.
What continues to be of great concern to us is the readiness and capacity of our hospital system, and it must be said here that as of today, there are three hundred and twenty-four patients hospitalised, twenty-eight of whom need intensive care and of whom there are sixteen people on controlled breathing and, unfortunately, three of them have left us in the last twenty-four hours. 
Let's take a look at the last, fiftieth week.
A total of additional three thousand one hundred and sixty-two cases were registered, which is an increase of eight percent in absolute terms compared to the previous week.
It can be said additionally that if we look at the testing, almost eleven or twelve percent of these positive tests are the so-called tenth-day tests, that is, when close contacts can take the test on the tenth day, we will see and detect another relatively large number of sick people which is very positive notion.
And the incidence of the disease continues to grow in ten counties, especially in Harju County, Jõgeva County, Järva County, Lääne-Viru County, Ida-Viru County, Pärnu County, Rapla County.
Currently, we are seeing such a tendency that the incidence of the disease starting from the north region is starting to fall downwards, to the south, that is, from Ida-Virumaa towards Tartu County, moving towards Võru County, which is actually creating such an attentive attitude towards these counties as well.
Nothing has changed in terms of places of infection, people become more infected in the family circle, at work, whereas there are other places of infection, as a result of which certain restrictions and limitations were established by the Government of the Republic.
We continue to be concerned about the number of cases of which we do not know the origin.
That number was thirty-four percent last week, which again suggests that we continue to be at a high risk of infection and the disease may be contracted anywhere.
We continue to register imported cases, but fortunately this number is falling by the week, and last week they were sixty-one.
And most of these cases  are brought in from Russia, Finland and Sweden.
Age structure.
As the number of cases is increasing, the number of cases is increasing in all age groups.
In most cases, there were more cases among people between the ages of sixty and sixty-nine.
They were seventeen percent, [people aged] fifty to fifty-nine were thirteen percent, and [people aged] forty to forty-nine were twelve percent.
The positive aspect is that last week, the number of cases at the age of ninety plus decreased by a quarter.
We know that Covid disease progresses both with and without symptoms, thus, last week, the proportion of patients without symptoms was ten percent.
And one hundred and eighty-seven people needed hospitalisation.
It is very important that almost eighty percent of those hospitalised were [of the age] sixty-plus, which also indicates that the disease is progressing and, and the course of the disease will be more serious in older people.
We continue to be concerned about social welfare institutions, which continue to be the most vulnerable places at risk, and we did a small analysis that when we compared fourteen days of morbidity per 100,000 inhabitants, both in nursing homes and among the general population, the risk of infection is almost seven times higher among the sixty-plus clients in nursing homes.
Again, if the disease ends up in nursing homes, it is a serious problem.
And, of course, we keep repeating that our healthcare system is currently under a very heavy burden.
And we must take any steps to ensure that all people who need hospital treatment, not only Covid-19 patients, but also people who come to the hospital with other issues, receive this treatment.
A few words about the incidence of the virus in Harju County.
As of today, the fourteen-day morbidity rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants was five hundred and fifty-eight point eighty-two.
The number in Tallinn was five hundred and ninety, in the city of Loksa, one thousand three hundred and thirty-eight, in the city of Maardu, seven hundred and fifty-one.
But let's compare it to the number of Ida-Virumaa again, where this figure is one thousand and fifty-three, so anyhow, Ida-Virumaa is currently the biggest concern for us.
In Harju County, there are almost seventeen thousand people under active surveillance, fourteen thousand of them are close contacts and more than three thousand have active cases of illness, and today we have twenty-four active foci, which are mostly at work, in workplaces, and at home and nursing homes.
And now, what should we do next, how should we behave?
Metaphorically speaking, in order for us to overcome this crisis, everything is very, very simple and clear.
Everybody who is ill should be able to rest in peace at home, and contact with them should be kept to a minimum for all patients who are at risk of infection.
So, this is the way we can beat the virus.
Well, this would be an ideal towards which we are moving.
But it is certainly not 100% feasible for us.
But then we all have to work together in order to not spread the virus and to help those in need of help.
And what we have to continue doing is that we have to adhere to the measures established in the country, keep our distance, wear a mask, reduce contacts,  avoid crowded places and events, [cancel] this time big parties.
And we usually have Christmas at home and in a close family and with the people with whom we interact on a daily basis and stay at home as much as possible and enjoy the beautiful Estonian nature to reduce the risk of getting infected ourselves and not passing the infection on to others.
I wish everyone a jolly Christmas mood and stay healthy, thank you!
Thank you, Dr. Irina Donchenko and now, let’s have an overview on the corona virus by the Tallinn Mayor Mikhail Kõlvart.
Hello, also on my part, based on the epidemiological situation, since as of this week, upper secondary school students are still on distance learning, lower secondary school students are on distance learning as well, but the content of the study includes primarily creative tasks and also such creative learning.
As was announced at the end of the last week, Tallinn municipal schools also offer primary school students this opportunity during the after-school care hours.
According to the today's data, this service is used by an average of three hundred children across Tallinn, so there is a need.
There are also Tallinn municipal hobby schools on distance learning.
This means that most of the activity takes place at a distance or does not take place at all.
But in contact learning, there are one-on-one lessons, which are also allowed.
And the situation in Tallinn kindergartens is now such that about fifty units are isolating or quarantined.
Forty-three employees are also isolating or quarantined.
Parallelly with today's teaching, schools are also preparing for January, based on different scenarios.
The Education Board is also dealing with mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resources in case we have to start distance learning in January.
Of course, we hope that there will be no such need, but we must also be prepared for this.
And we have once again discussed the situation with our education representatives, including school and municipal school principals, social representatives, representatives, but also with our hospital managers.
We will continue to try to keep the situation under control, but we will also think about what needs to be further prepared in the event of the deterioration of the situation.
And also, on behalf of the city, we continue to turn to the citizens, [asking them] to keep their distance and to wear a mask at outdoor events, [in spite of] the the fact that there is no such legal obligation.
But it would make perfect sense if we wish at least that this opportunity would be open for the Christmas so that the city could organise these outdoor events.
So, once again, I make a great request to you, it is up to us how the situation develops.
There is no need to expect such stricter regulations from the state, from the city, thinking that the rules are intended to protect us.
And we can cope without anyone monitoring, controlling and punishing us, without these rules and to act independently and accordingly.
And so, once again, keeping the distance and wearing the mask is relevant not only indoors but also outdoors.
Especially, when it comes to events.
Thank you!
Thank you, Mr. Mayor, at today's meeting of the city government, the city government appointed the director of municipal communications.
Now, he is introduced by Mihhail Kõlvart, the Mayor.
And at today's meeting of the city government, he was appointed the head of the new urban service.
This service is called the communication service.
The service will start working as of 1 January, but of course urban communication is already in function and is working continuously.
And we also have the head of communications who has been involved in this work for the last year and a half.
And who has also been elected head of the communications service.
We are talking about Kirsti Ruul and Kirsti Ruul is attending a press conference today and I will give her the floor.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Kirsti should be an extremely familiar person to you, dear journalists, let there be said as a confirmation that there was actually a public competition for this position and Kirsti Ruul came out the winner.
From 1 January, the city's head of communications.
Kirsti, give us your greetings in the new upcoming office.
XXX for the baton.
Indeed, I have worked on Tallinn's communications and urban media development for over a year.
And I also decided to run for head of communications.
that I see untapped resources to make Tallinn a more open, friendly, comfortable living environment via communication, just as the development strategy Tallinn envisages twenty thirty-five.
For such a green metropole.
Of course, openness and friendliness do not only derive from communication or the efforts of the city government, only from the joint activities and co-operation in which the citizens, companies and the city government contribute.
As a professional, there is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge in running the communication of such a large group.
Nearly twenty thousand people work here.
The activities of this group affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
Tallinn is undergoing major changes that are taking place in the management of Tallinn, and communication has a role to play in how these changes will actually work out.
Restructuring in Tallinn's communications or city media department began as early as the autumn of the year twenty nineteen.
And we will continue to make any effort that important news in the city reaches all people.
I thank you for such trust and I try to work as well as I can.
Thank you!
Thank you, Kirsti Ruul, the city's head of communications since the first of January, twenty twenty-one.
Christmas and the end of the year are approaching with inevitable rush, then fireworks will be shot at the end of the year and other related activities will be taken up.
And today, warnings both from the Mayor and a representative of the Society for the Protection of Animals.
Mihhail Kõlvart, the Mayor.
Yes, one of the symbols of the New Year is traditionally fireworks.
The city has also organised it every year and this year maybe this event will be of special significance.
First of all, well, we all need positive emotions, which we haven't had very many lately.
And the city government has tried to provide this emotion in urban spaces.
At the same time, we must keep in mind the current epidemiological situation.
Thus, of course, the traditional event on Freedom Square will not be held.
And we recommend spread the people out.
Thus, fireworks display will take place this year in different places, different districts, in almost every district, except Nõmme and Kristiine.
Today, six locations have been chosen where fireworks display will take place.
And once again, we turn to the citizens, if we want these events to take place, to have fireworks organised by the city, then it is necessary to keep our distance and to wear a mask.
However, the locations have been chosen in such a manner to allow this.
But we have another very important appeal to the people of Tallinn.
Because we organise the display of fireworks centrally in different places, hoping that the people themselves will not organise nor buy them on their own, nor will they start firing fireworks.
Because it is an issue for both humans and animals.
Plus, this is a problem that occurs every year and we need to realise that it is not eco-friendly either.
And we truly hope that this understanding will spread among our people more extensively this year.
Because there are professionals who are able to shoot the fireworks in a professional manner and that is why we do it, [so] all displays of fireworks on a private basis should be abandoned, as we try to protect each other, but also [for the sake of] our smaller friends, and I would be happy to give the floor to a representative of the Animal Welfare Society. 
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Yes, Kaisa Kamm, the head of direct assistance to the Estonian Society for the Protection of Animals, is participating in the press conference, so the happy celebration of the New Year makes you a bit worried.
Go ahead.
Hello also from the Estonian Society for the Protection of Animals.
And first of all, I am very pleased that every year, the more there is talk about the negative effects of fireworks on both animals and the environment.
Here, too, many thanks to Tallinn, who is now organising such displays of fireworks in a safe environment, and I hope that this will not be a one-off event, and that other cities and municipalities will follow suit.
So, the reasons why these fireworks are so worrisome for the Estonian Society for the Protection of Animals are many.
First of all, it is not only an issue for our domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, but also for the general urban animals, that include also horses, birds.
But I think, firstly, I would like to talk about the animals we keep at home.
Fireworks cause them a lot of frustration because they are loud and it creates irrational fear in dogs.
Because they do not know how to behave, they start to run away, they freeze, and I believe that if anyone manages to study the statistics of the Tallinn Animal Shelter, there are very many of these dogs that have ran away, to the extent that it might cause accidents.
Plus, just worry.
In addition, then there are birds who are in the city.
They either fly very far, they don't get back, they run out of food.
We are just causing them a great deal of suffering for no reason at all.
That is why it would be very good if you just went to places that have been inspected, we know where these events are taking place.
Animal owners can look up themselves where these fireworks take place and we don't have to be afraid that if they go to the yard with their dog, then there will be indiscriminate shooting of fireworks.
This is one of our main concerns.
Thank you!
And probably from this point on, you can still supplement and ask that, if it is possible now, parents kept an eye on their little ones, and that they do not necessarily have to fire their DIY, self-initiated fireworks on Christmas Eve and the first day of Christmas.
So, maybe somehow we can get rid of this habit.
But here you probably need parental care and teaching what works for something and what doesn't.
Anyway, thank you, Kaisa Kamm, head of direct assistance to the Estonian Society for the Protection of Animals.
Dear journalists, do you have any questions for the participants in our press conference?
We do not see any questions, but, Mayor, as scheduled, we have our last gathering in this press conference room this year.
We never rule out that there may be a necessity of an unscheduled post-session, press conference or another gathering.
Anyhow, as planned, we are here for the last time, because this year, because next week the city government will be sitting in the town hall.
let’s hope that the corona situation will allow it.
Yes, thank you, indeed, Christmas and New Year are approaching.
There is also such a traditional wish to look back, draw conclusions and share plans for next year.
But what I want to confirm from the city government, is that our daily work does not end with the holidays.
To this end, there is also a special need today for the situation to be constantly monitored and, if necessary, for operational decisions to be taken.
Especially, taking into account the current situation.
But we are ready to do it each day.
I think we know what do we need to do.
And no matter how the situation develops, we can confirm on behalf of the city that we are ready for different scenarios, we are ready to support and help the townspeople, and we also have the confidence that we manage do it anyway.
And I don't think that such faith is just an emotion.
This faith is also the very strong energy and energetics that we have.
Because what we have to do, we are ready to act and we hope and call on the people, the people of Tallinn and the people of Estonia as a whole, to the current situation in the same way.
Yes, all is not well, it's bad.
But we can do it, if we want to.
If we understand that it is up to us how the situation begins to develop and everyone takes the responsibility, not just the leaders, but each citizen.
Already now, I would like to wish everyone a peaceful Christmas and this time also a peaceful New Year, so, this time it must all be very peaceful.
And we will gather strength to be ready for the challenges of the next year, and there will be many of them, and not just those related to the Coronavirus crisis.
But once again, I believe I'm sure we can do this together, thank you.
Thank you, Mayor Mikhail Kõlvart, thank you all the participants in the press conference.
Now, it's time for the interviews, have a nice day and stay healthy.
Good evening, just a brief summary about the day that is coming to an end: new facts about the shipwreck of MS Estonia, the new Tallinn Hospital and the coronavirus in Latvia.
This is “Aktuaalne Kaamera” on Thursday, 1st of October.
In the current light, it seems that even this additional video footage filmed underwater is a super important evidence that should be brought to light.
The documentary film-makers of the MS Estonia did not disclose the whole truth about the new footages.
The first procurement for the construction of a new Tallinn Hospital was announced.
What is really very important now is that the hospital will become a modern research centre.
The coronavirus has started to spread again in Latvia.
Let's sum up the day now.
There are more damage spots in the hull of the sunken MS Estonia than a single large hole described in the report which was prepared by the Estonian nautical experts who studied the Discovery footages before their release.
The report was presented to the government that has so far basically mentioned a major hole, the cause of which needs to be investigated.
Before the film was released, the authors showed the underwater footages to Mart Luik, adviser to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and to the Estonian nautical experts.
Based on what was seen in Oslo, experts drafted a report in which, in addition to the hole of a height of four metres and a width of two metres shown in the film, there is another damage, rather similar to a rupture, in the hull of the same vessel.
Mart Luik said that he did not see the material including the other damage, because he was giving an interview to the journalist at the same time.
There, first of all, there a seabed was seen, and the seabed there is actually like a rocky ground, not as the film-makers actually claimed, right and, and as if they also saw the damage.
I will show Estline in this part of the letter.
The draft material of the film was thus shown only to the Estonian experts who had visited Oslo.
The film-makers then invited us four who were involved with their own computers as experts, and showed us another additional video clip, which was not included into the series.
And there, in this series then, or I mean, in this clip, there was shown another additional damage spot.
They said they would then show it to us before releasing it just for our information.
The report was introduced to the government that has so far mentioned only a big hole.
They actually referred to the government in a few sentences in a short report which they had summarised.
But then why has the government always stated that there is one hole and they have not mentioned any more damages?
Certainly, the key is undoubtedly this one hole.
What was actually described in these shots, that I think what the eyewitnesses saw, I think, the experts who saw these shots, I think it makes sense for them to definitely tell this to the public, there is nothing to hide here.
The experts themselves have not previously referred to other damage at the request of the Norwegian camera crew.
Since they asked us not to mention this additional material, it was in fact like a chance for us to tell them about it first.
But as these speculations have surfaced very quickly here, so in the current light it seems that the additional video footage that has been filmed underwater is also a very important thing, the evidence that should come to light.
Discovery today informed ERR in writing that, according to the government's request, they would forward the draft material to Estonia.
Discovery also stated that in addition to the hole, they discovered other injuries in the hull, but the series only displays discoveries that the authors considered to be important from the media standpoint.
And now we are having in the studio Kristjan Tabri, senior researcher at Tallinn University of Technology and a PhD in Maritime Engineering.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Well, can it now be said with certainty that the film-makers were telling lies and did not reveal the complete truth?
Well now, I personally cannot answer this question exactly, what would be their motives to publish something or not to publish anything, but obviously, we have seen materials that have a very big weight as evidence so... so in that sense, yes, I reckon that it would have probably been correct to publish these materials in the series though.
So, let’s go deeper into the subject now, what did you find in these materials and what kind of damage was seen on the hull of the Estonia?
In unofficial terms, we saw a relatively short clip, such as from fifteen to twenty seconds, which depicted allegedly also Estonia.
Materials shot during the same filming, where one could see the seabed, which was rather rocky, one could also see a relatively large damage towards the stern of the ship.
Are you referring to the object that was mentioned in addition to what has been talked about right now?
Yes, in addition to that.
So, correct me if I’m wrong, but this could not even be filmed near Estonia, when you were talking about the fifteen-second video that was allegedly shot there?
Well, I would still suppose that it has been shot near Estonia, as the context is Estonia, after all.
So could you please describe the surface on which Estonia lies on currently - the wreck, and what caused the damage in your opinion?
Well, we saw this seabed in these videos for a maximum amount of time of twenty seconds, that’s why it is surely a difficult task to give a sufficient answer based on that, whereas what can be seen and what is apparent actually in the disclosed video, is the fact that the seabed is quite hard there.
And the damage is caused by what exactly?
I personally would suggest that this damage is caused by the fact that the ship is lying horizontally on the seabed on a relatively hard soil being obviously an uneven surface.
And the shipwreck, as I understand, has started to sink in the opinion of the experts?
Well, that is what they are saying, that also them in this series, that allegedly they, during the filming they detected the current angle of the ship or in other words, the heeling angle, that differs twelve degrees from the one recorded after the disaster.
So, two damage locations may be seen in the video, one of which being near to the letter “e”, the other one nearer to the stern.
Is it possible, according to your view, that more ruptures may have been caused?
Well, I personally did not see any more ruptures, I would say that also from the materials disclosed, actually other dents may be seen on the parts that are not in contact with the soil anymore, but where there may be clearly seen colour damage that has been caused by a collision with the ground.
But I would not rule out the possibility that there may be a third or a fourth damage location somewhere.
A hole or a rupture, I would not know how to call this, located nearer to the stern, but is it higher or below the first one?
From the location of the opening, it is very difficult for us to make any assumptions, where is it, but it seemed to be more or less above the stabilisatior, near the stabilisator notably nearer to the stern, probably more to the stern from the word “Estline”, but I suppose it is bulky, approximately more above the beam of the collision or in other words, at the same height as the original opening.
Finally, your opinion as a scientist.
These holes have not been created by a collision with an unknown object, are they?
Well, it is really complicated to build such a scenario where by the cause of a collision, two holes of such size and with such a distance are created.
So it appears very likely that these openings have been created, lying on the seabed.
And to sum up, is it necessary to commence a new investigation process or to bring to the surface the shipwreck MS Estonia?
I think that surely the salvage of the wreck has no point and that the use of modern devices allows us to collect very much information also on the seafloor.
It is very difficult for me to assess, how much the emergence of the new rupture convinces people, in the sense that if it actually increases the number of the believers of the official report or not.
[Like] it is surely possible to find out the cause of these openings.
It seems that it is continuously unclear the fact that people do not believe the official theory that if the water flows into the bow then this ship will sink and then actually it would be possible to show this during the investigation by using modern methods and that this kind of ship will sink in such an event.
Thank you, Kristjan Tabri, for these comments.
Thank you.
According to Mart Helme, Ministry of Interior, the Estonian government has currently the capacity and funds to go to the bottom of the sea at the wreck site and conduct preliminary survey on the bottom and the hull of the ship.
The salvage of the wreck of MS Estonia is out of question.
In Estonia, for the preliminary survey of the wreck, there is a sonar, a submarine robot diving to a depth of three hundred metres, and a vessel “General Kurvits”, which has a low freeboard height.
This means that it is possible to assist divers and control the diving robot.
The diving robot has so far been used to search for human remains and pieces of evidence.
We are able to do this with our partners, with the technical capacity that we have, but we certainly need other experts by our side and perhaps also some international help.
According to Kohtla, it is still the divers who is able to provide any accurate information.
There are divers in the Navy, but they can't dive near to the wreck of MS Estonia, it lies far too deep.
If our own camera and probe work confirms all the new information that came out in the Discovery’s documentary, we need to move on to the next steps and the other research activities.
And in that case, we are going to talk about hiring an already internationally prestigious underwater company that will do further research.
The preliminary work will cost from five million.
If divers are called to help, the cost of research will rise up to twenty million.
Salvage of the wreck will cost one hundred million euros, and the government is not considering this option.
According to Helme, one could go to the MS Estonia's wreck site and start with the work already tomorrow, but first, it is necessary to hold negotiations with Finnish and Swedish counterparts.
MS Estonia sailed under the Estonian flag, the wreck is located in the Finnish EEZ.
Estonia has also joined the peace of grave agreement.
We certainly do not want to quarrel with our partners over the new investigation into MS Estonia, to quarrel and to engage in violent actions that will cause us to deteriorate diplomatic and international relations.
Who owns the wreck of Estonia anyway?
Well, that's a good question, I cannot answer it right now.
Estonia is the flag state, therefore Estonia must, of course, take the leadership role.
According to Helme, it is planned to call journalists and organisations uniting the relatives of the victims to join the research.
Additional eighty-one new people infected with the coronavirus were registered in Estonia during the last day.
The tests were performed two thousand six hundred and eighty-six persons.
The two-week infection rate per 100,000 inhabitants is now over fifty, more specifically, fifty decimal sixty-four.
The highest number of infected persons was registered in Harju County, i.e. thirty-seven, in Ida-Viru County twenty-seven people tested positive on the last day, seven new infected persons were added to Võrumaa, two to Viljandi and Põlva County and one to Pärnu and Tartu County.
As of this morning, thirty-six people in Estonia need hospital treatment due to the virus.
Two patients are ventilated.
An eighty-four-year-old woman infected with the coronavirus died at West Tallinn Central Hospital.
We can note that most of the infections in Estonia have occurred in the family circle, in the work circle, in the circle of acquaintances or even at school, or in other words, it may be assumed that it was still a previous close contact and therefore are such.
As we have a lot of close contacts at the moment, that's why there is such a big increase in numbers.
We can expect it to grow, and that is because we are really at the beginning of the season for respiratory viral infections now, and, well, this is a little inevitable right now.
In Latvia, the number of people infected with the coronavirus has recently increased, the average infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants has risen to seventeen point six.
At the heart of the virus outbreak in Kuldiga, saliva samples have been introduced as a pilot project for mass testing of people.
The heads of the laboratory of Kulbis, which organises the testing activity, assured "Aktuaalne Kaamera" that this will be the fastest and easiest way to find out where the virus has spread and how common it is in a few days.
The method itself, as confirmed here in the laboratory of Gulbis, is nothing new.
The material that is examined in the laboratory is simply another.
The sample is not taken from the nasopharynx but from the saliva, and this has already proved its worth in several countries in situations where a large number of people need to be tested quickly and there are no nurses who could arrange for this routine testing.
So, for the first time in Latvia, there is a situation where more than three thousand people have been tested in Kuldiga, Daugavpils will be next, and if these outbreaks should occur in other places, it is namely this saliva test that they hope would help identify the people who have contracted the virus and to keep things in Latvia under control.
There are five test kits in this box, so one can even test the whole family at once.
The saliva sample can be given by anyone.
The job of the laboratory is to organise the distribution of these thousands of test kits, collect them, deliver them to the laboratory and find people to examine them.
According to Dr. Kavarsi and also Uga Dumpis from the main infection centre of Latvia, the experience of other countries shows that these tests are reliable and may also be used in work teams, for example, for frequent testing of police officers and social workers.
nasopharyngeal samples are still taken at collection points.
taking the test is voluntary and free of charge.
A referral letter is still not required for nasopharyngeal testing in Latvia.
We are also live from Riga.
Good evening, Ragnar, does the Latvian government plan to tighten any restrictions in the light of the changed situation?
Good evening, restrictions have already been tightened in Kuldiga and Daugavpils.
There are currently no plans to tighten national restrictions on the spot, which means that taking up hobby activities is currently banned in Kuldiga and Daugavpils, and masks must be worn in public places.
There are more restrictions.
So, what happened in Kuldiga?
The outbreak started from a local textile company and it happened very suddenly, at first, one person became ill, then there were some more, then they were almost twenty, and now there are more than thirty employees of the textile company who have tested positive, so the people in Kuldiga do not understand how this could happen so fast, but this is the way it went.
now it concerns the whole of Latvia, thus the chief infection control officer, Uga Dumpis has made an urgent recommendation that anybody who can, should now do remote working, work from home, and in fact, we can see that the Latvian Parliament, for example, has already heard this recommendation.
The Latvian Saeima will once again hold remote sessions, and the Latvian government, by the way, has been holding remote sessions since the spring, and it is hoped that the schools will be kept open.
There are currently at least one infected person in more than twenty educational institutions, and so we will see, how this will develop.
Well, there is also the question on the agenda of whether the infection rate should be raised from sixteen to twenty-five now, which will probably be done tomorrow, but anyway, it will not change substantially anything, because there are only three countries now that remain below the threshold and, and if also Finland is considered, for example, it means that for Latvia, those coming from Finland do not have to self-isolate here, so the ferry service between Helsinki and Riga has already been suspended, so there is no actual point anymore [of rising the threshold].
But there is one more news from Riga, today the Saeima decided that as of 12 October, everybody who enters Latvia will have to start filling in declarations and an electronic database will be launched, so that the procedure will become stricter.
Thank you.
Next up, the session of the European Council started in Brussels.
Estonia, together with several other countries, expects a firm decision on sanctions against Belarus.
The leaders are in a difficult position, as Cyprus has associated the imposition of sanctions to the relations between the European Union and Turkey which are also under discussion today.
Moreover, although the leaders reaffirm their solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they must weigh their steps very carefully in their relations with Turkey.
A decision on sanctions against Belarus should be made tonight.
We will discuss very important foreign policy issues concerning Belarus, Turkey, China, Nagorno-Karabakh and the issue of the poisoning of Navalny.
Certainly, our message is that, when it comes to Belarus, I very much hope that we can move forward with sanctions.
We surely support the free society in Belarus, we demand that the new presidential elections be fair and transparent.
And now, live from Brussels.
Good evening, Joosep, so what's the latest news?
Good evening.
This has been a relatively dramatic day here in Brussels.
At first, it was expected that relations between Turkey and the European Union would be discussed in the last part of the discussion, but Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, took a rather wise step and made changes to the agenda.
He put the topic of the relations between Turkey and the European Union at the top of the agenda, and this has actually been discussed by the leaders for several hours now, although there is now a forty-five minute break, after which there will be dinner and then the topic will be discussed further.
It is well-known that a so-called plan of conclusions was actually talked about or discussed at the discussion of leaders, which also went to the vote. Cyprus and Greece rejected it, saying that the approach was too soft.
It is clear that Cyprus has to reduce some sanctions against Turkey, whether they will be put in place, I do not know yet.
If this item will actually be solved, it will already be possible to talk about sanctions against Belarus.
It may be assumed that, if the issue regarding Turkey is resolved, the sanctions on Belarus will be decided in no time.
After that, some more, let's say, declarative issues will be discussed, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, the conflict regarding Nagorno-Karabakh, where it is then desired that Armenia and Azerbaijan resolved the issue.
Relations between the European Union and China, as well as the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, where the issue will namely be condemned.
So, as we heard, tonight the European Council is having a long discussion on foreign affairs.
So, let’s have a longer talk tomorrow, thank you for now.
The Spanish government has decided to partially close several areas, including Madrid, due to the extensive spread of the coronavirus, and new health rules were published today.
In the future, only six people may gather, and the opening hours of restaurants and bars will be limited.
The new measures cover areas where five hundred people per a hundred thousand inhabitants have been infected in the last two weeks, where at least ten percent of coronavirus tests have been positive and where patients have occupied more than thirty-five percent of intensive care units.
The European Commission sent a memo to the United Kingdom for breach of its obligations under the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
This marks the official start of infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom and they will have one month to respond to the memo.
The draft law on the protection of the internal market was approved the day before yesterday by the House of Commons of the British Parliament, which gives London a unilateral right to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland and grossly violates the Ireland-Northern Ireland Protocol to the withdrawal agreement.
In Hong Kong, the passing of seventy-one years since the founding of the People's Republic of China in the year one thousand nine hundred and forty-nine was celebrated.
During the celebration, the police captured sixty people who are accused of unauthorised demonstrations.
Demonstrations were also held in front of the Chinese Embassy in Tallinn, where freedom was demanded for the special economic zone.
According to a young man from Hong Kong living in Estonia, the fate of the democratic movement in his home country is currently in a critical state due to both Beijing's enforcement measures and the spread of the coronavirus.
This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, which is why we ask the Estonian citizens and the members of the Estonian Parliament to help Hong Kong.
And how it works is that the members of the Estonian Parliament have to support the Hong Kong Support Group in the Parliament.
Now, let’s go back to the domestic topics.
Today, the Tallinn City Government announced the international procurement of medical devices for Tallinn Hospital which will be built in the year two thousand twenty-six.
The time limit for the procurement is the second of November.
The government coalition considers the budget strategy of Tallinn hospitals to be the largest investment, but the opposition points out that investments were allowed to be made for loan money, but the hospital will be built in most part for the European funds.
The total cost of Tallinn Hospital is up to five hundred million euros.
For this, the government is requesting three hundred and eighty million euros of funding within the framework of the European Union recovery plan, which was created due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Yes, it is indeed a recovery fund, and from there it is the easiest and most appropriate way to apply for a support, given the fact that it is a so-called supplementary fund and not a so-called long-term funding of the European Union [with a time limit of] twenty, twenty-one to two thousand twenty-seven in addition to the normal budget.
Mihhail Kõlvart, the Mayor of Tallinn said that the city will contribute one hundred million euros to the construction of the Tallinn Hospital.
If the project for the new hospital will not be confirmed, the city will have to renovate the East Tallinn and West Tallinn Central Hospitals, which do not meet the requirements, to the same extent, Kõlvart added.
These buildings are also a resource that we can use in the future, primarily since it is a property that can be realised in the future and [used as] an additional funding for the project of the Tallinn Hospital.
According to Kõlvart, it has not been decided whether the property will be used to finance the new hospital or it will be used to satisfy the needs of the city.
Today, the procurement of the preliminary design of the medical equipment of Tallinn Hospital was announced, because without it it is not possible to organise an architectural competition and to design the hospital.
A separate procurement will be organised later for the purchase of medical equipment.
What is really very important now is that the hospital will become a modern research centre, where all modern medical technologies can also be applied.
it was missing that this resource is not enough already now, in order to provide high-quality medical services. In the future there should be two main medical centres in Tallinn: North Estonia Medical Centre and Tallinn Hospital, Kõlvart added.
It is estimated that Tallinn Hospital will service fifty percent of Tallinn patients and fifty percent of patients coming from any other Estonian counties.
First of all, of course, we intend the regions of Northern Estonia, Central Estonia, islands.
According to Aivar Sõerd, the former Minister of Finance belonging to the Reform Party, the government's story that the loan money is used for investments is not true.
It is gone in no time, he added.
Yes, Tallinn Hospital was mentioned as the largest investment, but it is [constructed, using] European funds, not loan money.
It is planned to start the construction of Tallinn Hospital in twenty twenty-three.
Today, the International Music Day was celebrated for the fifth time worldwide.
Free concerts were also heard all across Estonia.
The day culminated with the gala where the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Endowment's annual prizes for music were awarded to the best musicians, composers and music developers.
The aim of the celebration of the International Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible.
In this way, unexpected places are chosen as concert venues.
For example, at one concert, the music of Arvo Pärt was performed alongside new cars.
And in such an environment that was completely perfect for the performance of music, we were able to stop the clock for a while, or to create a certain feeling [here] or a sense of eternity, that both those who sell cars here each day and we, who make music, right, become a sort of an organic whole, and I think it's nice on the [International] Music Day that this music reaches the places where we wouldn't expect it to belong and that all of this would suit into this sphere of eternity (kas automüügiesindus on igavikusfäär?) in any way. 
But the International Music Day seems to bring it to the forefront.
The children's choirs of Estonian Radio brought joy of the music to the inhabitants of Pärnu.
When the Estonian Television girls' choir is comes home to you, they are probably here in Estonia only because half of the world is closed down due to the coronavirus.
So, this is very nice that we are able to listen to such a choir.
And what is more awesome, it’s all free of charge.
As a tradition, the musicians who stood out the most during the season were recognised by the Estonian Cultural Endowment by granting annual music awards, and this Year, ten annual awards of five thousand euros and one award of courtesy were granted.
Amongst others, Mihkel Poll, pianist, was granted the annual award for an outstanding creative work as a soloist and a chamber musician.
The group Puuluup was awarded for a unique enrichment of the Estonian folk music, and the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and Olari Elts for the classical music album of the symphonic poems of Heino Eller.
The Estonian Music Council awarded its composition prize to Urmas Sisask and the interpretation prize to Peep Lassmann.
Estonia became richer by a new fish species.
The fish bearing the name of the western tubenose goby is the eighty-ninth species found in the Estonian waters.
Yesterday morning, Estonian ichthyologists caught two specimens of a new species near the port of Sillamäe.
The new alien species, the western tubenose goby, is a fish of approximately ten centimetres that is easy to confuse with local goby species.
However, the new alien species is recognisable by its elongated nostrils.
In the past, the western tubenose goby has been caught in the Baltic Sea only once, in two thousand seven in the Russian waters.
And like most alien species, this fish reached our waters with the ballast water of ships.
its home is in the waters of the Caspian and Black Seas, which is why it has not begun to exponentially breed in our cool waters.
I would think that it would not cause any major changes to our aquatic ecosystems, but like all living organisms, they will still compete with our native species for food and habitat, but I do not think that the impact will be as drastic as in the case of round gobies.
Now Ott will talk about the weekend’s weather that will just be absolutely fantastic.
Good evening.
Today, we had a clear and and mostly sunny weather, but the sun shone through the cloudy sky, because the wind carried smoke here from the landscape fire in southern Russia.
From Poland to the Black Sea, the low-pressure system above the Carpathians rolled in rain clouds to our way, and a front of rain clouds could be seen to the west, running from France over the North Sea near Iceland.
Tomorrow, a large high-pressure system will remain above Russia, and in addition, the new high-pressure system will be strengthened far away in the Barents Sea, and as a result, the weather will be rainy in Finland, most of Scandinavia and the Baltics.
On the western side, however, the Baltic Sea region is targeted by a low-pressure system, which is the reason the weather around our coastal waters is gusty.
It is raining in southern Norway, Denmark and around the southern region of the Baltic Sea.
Saturday will not bring any significant changes as we will remain under the impact of the high-pressure system over Russia and no rain clouds are expected.
The night ahead will be partly cloudy and without precipitation.
There is fog in some areas.
East and south-east wind blows from three to eight metres per second, on islands, in gusts of eleven metres per second.
The air temperature is four to nine degrees, on the coast up to thirteen degrees.
In the morning it will be partly cloudy, rainy and fog some places may continue to be foggy.
East and south-east wind blows from three to eight metres per second, on islands, in gusts of eleven metres per second and there will be expected five to ten degrees, on the coast a little bit more, up to twelve degrees.
Also, during the day there will be no precipitation and it will be partly cloudy.
Mostly eastern wind of four to ten metres per second will blow, with gusts of thirteen metres per second on the coast and daily peaks rising to eighteen degrees.
Beautiful sunny weather starts on the weekend, but on Sunday, there will be showers all over Estonia during the day.
The upcoming week will also be rainy, but it will be rather warm.
The average nightly temperature will be between nine to thirteen and during the day, the temperature will be between fifteen and seventeen degrees.
Before the rain starts, we are still able to enjoy the sun for a few days.
Have a good evening.
And finally, let's talk about money.
A purse full of coins is by far not an indicator of wealth anymore.
and [since] the two cents have become a nuisance rather than a worthy means of payment, the plan to stop striking them is once again being discussed in Europe.
As of Monday, everyone will be able to write a letter to the European Commission whether the one and two cents should remain in use.
The German cashier considers it a very worthwhile idea.
However, a British living in a French village asks not to abolish cents, because rounding up prices would hit the wallets of French peasants hard.
Sirje who was shopping in the store, has nothing against losing one and two cents, because handling them is inconvenient.
For old people in particular, they are not easy to handle, they disappear, fall on the ground and have virtually no value.
According to Aili Tamme, a shopkeeper, we already now rarely see one- and two-cents and cashiers are having trouble giving change, because most prices end by number nine.
Everyone says they have put the cents in a bowl at home.
We have a real problem with them.
Bank of Estonia places twenty-one million coins a year in circulation, more than half of which are one- or two-cents.
As a rule, they do not return to the bank and they disappear somewhere.
That is actually quite an issue.
Whether it is a nuisance, I do not dare to say, but fifty percent of the coins we issue are one- and two-cents, thus, this ratio is absolutely illogical.
Many European countries have already given up their use, because they are more trouble than they're worth.
Latvia and Slovenia were also quite close to make this decision, but they gave up the idea under the pressure posed on them by pensioners who were afraid of rising prices.
According to Roose, there is no need to round prices when giving up cents, and the soap may still cost ninety-nine cents in the future.
So, if we buy different products, for example, some soap, milk and bread... white bread is not healthy, you don’t want to buy it, right, but for example, lean curd and then head to the checkout.
Then the idea is that the price of the products we have selected is rounded up do it to the nearest five cents.
Whether one and two cents will become history in Europe will become clear during the next year when the European Commission's public consultation will end.
At a first glance, the opinion of no Estonian was published on the European Commission's website.
Maybe I have to inform Brussels myself then.
I have nothing against abolishing the use of cents because I pay by card.
And as an introduction to sports news, I can say so much that FC Flora puts up a fight, but Juhan Kilumets goes deeper into the subject, so have a nice evening.
Good evening, "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Tuesday, December 22nd.
The first Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to arrive in Estonia has no serious side effects, but reactions may occur.
People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, or have an acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated.
Elmo Nüganen, the general director of Tallinn City Theater, will resign at the end of the season.
And a hundred vehicles of the Defense Forces arrived in Paldiski port.
The importance lies in the fact that they are much cheaper than the new vehicles.
Let's sum up the day.
The working principle of the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to arrive in Estonia is completely new.
According to Alari Hirs, Medical Adviser of the State Medicines Agency, it causes vaccination reactions, but there are practically no serious side effects.
Estonia is already waiting for its first shipment of coronavirus vaccine this week, when the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be marketed in Europe should arrive.
This is a new type of vaccine with a different working principle.
When current vaccines attempt to introduce an attenuated pathogen, a non-living pathogen, or a component of a pathogen into a human to produce immunity, these vaccines incorporate a biomolecule that signals the body's own cells to produce one component of the virus.
A viral protein that is not a virus and does not harm it, but informs the body's immune system that such an external enemy must be fought.
Studies show that this vaccine protects people against symptomatic coronavirus infection.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and whether it prevents the spread of asymptomatic cases, remains to be found out.
One week after the first dose of the vaccine, the body is partially protected.
a new jab should be made one day later and the promised immunity develops seven days after the second jab.
according to XXX, the vaccine is very effective, nine out of ten potential diseases may be prevented.
As it is a very effective vaccine, it causes quite a lot of vaccination reactions to balance it, so a painful injection site is very common and of the general reactions, a feeling of tiredness or a general change in feeling lasting one to two days is also quite common.
Currently, there are almost no serious side effects.
The IRS cited America, for example, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated to date and have experienced six more serious reactions, two of which were rapid allergic reactions.
Therefore, it is recommended that people be monitored on the spot for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination.
the vaccine should not be given to people with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine.
According to the IRS, these components are known to vaccinating doctors.
People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, or an acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated, for example.
Normal, like a cold, or even if a person suspects that he or she has suffered from Covid-19 infection, is not a contraindication.
It is not possible to say yet whether those vaccinated in December will have to get a new jab already in the summer.
According to XXX, it has now been proven that the immune response lasts for at least three months.
The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long duration, but research is still ongoing.
and Moderna are testing their vaccines against a rapidly spreading strain of Coronavirus in the UK.
XXX said it would take two weeks to find out, but scientifically, it is highly likely that the vaccine will be able to contain the new strain of the virus.
According to XXX, the virus is known to have nine mutations.
Moderna is also performing tests, but it is assumed that the vaccine can protect against the new strain.
Additional five hundred and sixty-seven people tested positive to Coronavirus in Estonia during the last twenty-four hours, three hundred and sixty-two of them were in Harju County.
A total of five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven Coronavirus tests were analysed in Estonia, thus, one tenth of the initial tests were positive.
As of the morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two Covid-19 patients in the hospital.
Six infected people died within a day, the youngest of whom was a sixty-four-year-old woman.
A total of one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with the Coronavirus have died in Estonia.
Recent results from the University of Tartu Coronavirus monitoring study show that the prevalence is widespread, but the number of virus carriers remains at the same level as a few weeks ago.
Apparently, the measures introduced in November, introduced at the end of November, such as the obligation to wear a mask and also the obligation to keep a distance, that they have some effect.
In other words, if these rules can be followed, and perhaps even somewhat better, then no additional restrictions would seem necessary.
But we can't predict exactly how people will behave exactly during the holidays, or that the holidays are a source of risk.
The number of Coronavirus patients in Latvian hospitals has grown to a thousand, so scheduled treatment is suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian government banned New Year's fireworks and imposes upon everyone from the age of seven to wear a mask on hiking trails and nature sites when more people gather.
At the same time, hotel accommodation in Latvia will be partially compensated during quarantine or isolation, or in case of minor illnesses, in order to prevent infection among family members.
Krišjanis Karinš, the Prime Minister advises everyone to prepare for severe movement restrictions, the morbidity will not decrease by the next week.
In the first stage, Latvia will receive the vaccine for less than five thousand medical workers.
Stands are being set up in dozens of hospitals for vaccination.
Elmo Nüganen, the head stage director of the Tallinn City Theater, announced that this season will be his last and at the end of the season, in the summer of the twenty twenty-one, he will put an end to his work as the head stage director of the City Theater.
Nüganen has run the city theater since the year nineteen ninety-two.
Parallelly, together with the head stage director, a new director will be sought for the theater, as the contract of the current director of the City Theater, Raivo Põldmaa, will expire in the spring.
He has not yet been able to answer whether the current director is running for a new term.
In any case, the theater is facing a great time of change, because Kristjan Suits, the chief artist, will also resign in February.
We ourselves could not get a comment from Elmo Nüganen in front of the camera today.
According to Raivo Põldmaa, the director of the City Theater, today's announcement did not come to the theater unexpectedly.
This is still a topic discussed in the theater, and such important changes in the theater are not made unexpectedly and they are prepared in advance for a long time.
Prepared for a long time by whom then?
By all of us, theater work is teamwork, repertory theater in particular, and all such important decisions are still discussed among themselves.
Did Elmo Nüganen himself take the initiative to resign?
Well, people still make those decisions themselves, Elmo made that decision himself, but well, the background idea is that we've been here for quite some time and space must be made for a new generation.
What has the City Theater been like under the reign of Elmo Nüganen?
Well, it has been a great time for this theater, it's a whole era.
One important stage ends here in the theater, opening up the possibility for the next important stages.
Russia summoned the ambassadors of Germany, France and Sweden to inform them of the extension of the list of prohibited persons.
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose whether EU officials who are no longer allowed to enter the country, simply saying that these are retaliatory measures against the sanctions imposed by the European Union.
In October, the European member states imposed sanctions on Russian officials for poisoning of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
However, a Kremlin spokesman accused the opposition politician of stalking mania when Navalny published a telephone recording on his website with the FSB agent involved in the poisoning.
Britain and France are continuing talks to end the Paris ban on trade and transport, said British Home Secretary Priti Patel.
According to the Minister of the Interior, keeping the trading activity going is in the interests of both countries.
France imposed a ban following the release of a new strain of Coronavirus.
According to the British Broadcasting, neighbouring countries will disclose the content of the agreement tomorrow.
According to one working version, mass testing of truck drivers will also be organised so that the goods could move before Christmas.
Great Britain and the European Union reduced disagreements over access to fish stocks, but this is only part of a larger jigsaw puzzle that remains unresolved on fish stocks, European Union sources said.
Michel Barnier, EU Chief Negotiator gave an overview of trade talks to the ambassadors of the EU member states.
Great Britain will leave the common market and the customs union on the thirty-first of December, and if no agreement is reached before then, customs tariffs will apply under the rules of the World Trade Organization.
In Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, more than twenty-five thousand people protested against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.
Protesters accused the prime minister of treason at a parliament building because he signed a ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan.
With the ceasefire agreement, Armenia relinquished the control of Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions of Azerbaijan.
the XXX region's authorities in Russia decided to take down the monument erected four days ago.
According to legend, Aljonka was founded two hundred and fifty years ago by Novaya Aljon, the village of Aljovka.
However, the two-metre high metal woman that was opened with a ceremony on 18 December, has become part of the social media outrage because she is considered horrible.
Some jester has called the metal Aljonka a monument for the whole year.
Today, a hundred vehicles arrived in the port of Paldiski, which were procured by the National Defense Investment Center.
This is the second part of a two-decimal supply of two million euros.
Last year, trucks and spare parts worth one million euros arrived in Estonia.
Eighty off-road vehicles, twenty tractors and twenty trailers and containers arrived today from the Netherlands.
Everything is in good condition, but used.
In the case of wheeled vehicles, it is extremely sensible to buy used equipment.
Since we use this technique quite less intensively and it would be more sensible to spend this limited taxpayer resource that we have been given on much more effective weapons which actually play a much bigger role on the battlefield.
But used doesn't equal bad.
The average age of cars is twenty years, but they are good to use for another fifteen years.
They are in good condition when we buy them from the Allies, but what is significant is that they are, they are much cheaper than the new vehicles.
For example, for the fleet of vehicles we received from the Netherlands today, for eighty vehicles, we saved almost one point six million euros, simply because we bought those vehicles used.
Estonian companies are engaged in the maintenance and repair of the wheeled equipment, which makes it possible to invest the money allocated for national defense back into the Estonian economy.
It is also good that reservists do not have to retrain with the arrival of new cars, because it is the same platform that is still used in the Defense Forces.
But soon, new equipment must be acquired.
Purchasing used equipment from the Allies has become increasingly complex.
Namely, because the Allies have shifted their priorities and estimated that they themselves needed technological devices more than they did when they thought they needed a decade ago.
And the future certainly means that we will buy more and more new vehicles, because we have no other choice.
As of the new year, the requirement for more secure buyer authentication in e-commerce will apply throughout the European Union.
In essence, this means that in order to pay, one must authenticate oneself in an online bank, which has been used in Estonia for many years.
As not all countries will switch to the new system at the same time, there may be obstacles to purchasing from e-shops in other European countries at the beginning of the year.
There is nothing new in the new system for the Estonian e-shopper.
If we have been used to making payments with a bank link or making a card payment here in Estonia before, then no matter which payment method we have chosen, we will be directed to the Internet bank to identify ourselves, and in that online bank I will actually confirm this payment method.
In principle, the same thing is now being extended to Europe on a mandatory basis.
The aim of the new system is to prevent online card fraud and, in the future, to introduce new authentication methods, such as biometric or app authentication.
However, at the beginning of the new year, one may encounter problems paying when making purchases from other European online stores.
In several countries, local supervisors have granted additional time extensions in the context of the local market which means that the introduction of new requirements does not take place simultaneously everywhere.
If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it in accordance with the European directive, an error will show up.
This usually means that the payment is not successful, in which case it also means basically that the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments under the new solution and then, some alternative payment methods have to be agreed upon with the merchant.
Among the countries with a higher e-commerce turnover, i.e. Italy and Germany, for example, are applying an additional transition period of a few months.
In the yard of Telliskivi Creative City and on the first floor of the Fotografiska photography centre one can see Bobby Sager's photo exhibition of children raised in war zones.
The author of the photos, American Bobby Sager, is an entrepreneur, society activist, philanthropist and a photographer.
For the past twenty years, he has lived and worked in conflict- and poverty-stricken communities around the globe.
As a result of these journeys, photos from this exhibition have also been prepared.
XXX hopes that his photographs will raise awareness of the consequences of war conflicts and the problems of affected communities, in particular the impact of the global refugee crisis on children.
The photographer has tried to capture not only anguish and pain, but also hope in the eyes of children who grew up in the midst of violence and injustice.
The name of the exhibition, Invisible Sun, symbolises the need of these children and their right to hope.
The exhibition will be open on the first floor of Fotografiska until 21 February and in the outdoor gallery of Telliskivi Creative City until 7 March.
Veronika Uibo will now talk about the weather.
Good evening.
It is sure humid and there will be gray fog as the low-pressure systems of the Atlantic have conquered Western Europe.
One tandem extends from the Norwegian coast to the Danish straits, the other is approaching the Bay of Biscay.
Russia still has a powerful high-pressure area, and today, the Baltic states remained on the border of the two pressure areas and managed not to catch the rain.
Tomorrow, the low-pressure area will move from the vicinity of the Danish straits across the Scandinavia to the Gulf of Bothnia and will raise the strong southeast and south wind tonight.
A depression, along with the rain, moves across the Baltic Sea, it starts raining in showers on the islands which move on to the mainland, turning into sleet and snow everywhere around midnight.
So, at night, hundreds of islands extend across the land.
It is snowing and sleeting, on the islands, sleet and rain are falling.
The wind blows predominantly southeast of five to twelve, on the coast up to fifteen and on the islands before midnight up to eighteen metres per second.
The temperature will be two degrees below zero east, up to one in the west and three degrees above zero on the islands.
And the roads are slippery here and there.
In the morning, the precipitation on the islands and the west coast of the continent become watery, with heavy snow and sleet in the interior of the continent.
The wind blows from the south and southeast, on the islands, turning to the southwest of four to ten, on the coast, in gusts of fourteen metres per second.
The temperature remains between one degree below and three degrees above zero.
And at the same time it gets mostly cloudy all day.
In the evening, the denser rain retreats back eastwards, and in some places, it’s drizzling.
There will also be sleet on the eastern border of Estonia.
The wind turns from southeast and south to southwest, on the islands and on the coast also towards the west of five to eleven, on the coast, fifteen metres per second.
The temperature rises to plus four degrees on the mainland and plus six degrees on the coast.
In mainland Estonia, roads are still slippery in many places.
Christmas Eve should be cloudy and warm, with drizzles in some places.
The temperature is usually on the plus side until the evening and then drops near to zero degrees.
It will be cloudy on Friday and sometimes, it will sleet and snow occasionally.
By Saturday, it will already have got somewhat cooler and it will occasionally snow a little.
On Sunday, there will be additional sleet and rain on the islands again.
In other words, instead of sledding, it is necessary to find an alternative activity instead.
But we would like to offer you something positive in the end, let's give it a try then.
Namely, a family lives in the city of Võru whose home has more than three thousand eight hundred objects with an imagery of an angel or a fairy.
The Home Museum of Angels which opened two years ago, has now obtained an additional valuable item.
In the Home Museum of Angels, in the midst of thousands of winged creatures, it soon becomes clear that the characters with wings like birds’ are angels and the creatures with butterfly wings are fairy-tale images.
The oldest Christmas ornament in the museum comes from the collection of a former collector, which his relatives living in Tartu now donated to the home of angels in Võru.
This year, I was gifted the rarest Christmas ball which is a hundred years old, or over a hundred years old depicting an angel.
It is made of glass, and inside this glass ball, in turn, there one more glass ball with an angel on it.
The housewife of the angels knows why more often women or children are portrayed as angels today.
Someone asked why is it that women, and that the archangels are all men, and then I said that I guess there must be a balance in the world, that the beauty of women is noticeable and that the beauty of women is more valued, whereas men are valued for their brains and strength.
So, consequently, women possess the tenderness and beauty.
It is said that children come in this world as angels, but they lose their wings and their guardian angel is the mother here on earth.
Think of only how many Christmas trees one could decorate with the material that is available here.
Have a peaceful evening!
Good evening, dear viewers of the “Aktuaalne kaamera” of the weekend of the eighth of November.
On Fathers’ Day, the title of the the Father of the Year was awarded to Arvo Tuvikene, ichthyologist and father of four.
Be interested in the activities of your children and the trends they are following and another important thing is to love and respect your children's mother and let it be clear to the children.
The US President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring America back together in the victory speech.
the law does not allow young people under the age of 18 to seek psychiatric help without a parental consent.
Although the authorities have repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without any help each month.
Nobody is banning anyone from putting on a mask right now, so please, people, wear a mask.
Is it really Jüri Ratas that has to tell you this?
In the victory speech, the US President-elect Joe Biden promised to reunite the country, saying it was time to heal.
In several major cities, American people came to the streets to celebrate [the event].
However, supporters of President Donald Trump still feel that the election process has not been honest.
Joe Biden, the newly elected US President, gave a victory speech in his home state of Delaware, saying that the Americans have spoken and led him to a clear victory.
People all across the country came to the streets and stayed there until late into the night.
Here, in the city of Philadelphia which is the state capital of Pennsylvania and which has attracted attention for the whole week, supporters of Joe Biden have gathered to celebrate.
At the Philadelphia counting centre, supporters of President Donald Trump packed up posters used for the demonstrations.
Proponents of Trump promised to continue the demonstrations in the coming days.
What is the mood for the next day of the future president's declarations, Maria-Ann Rohemäe reports from the middle of the events.
Good evening.
I am currently standing at the Philadelphia City Council's counting center in Pennsylvania, and it was namely this state, and indeed, this area, that’s votes were decisive for the victory of the newly elected President Joe Biden.
Behind me, there is a small group of supporters of President Donald Trump.
Although they are not as many here as a few days ago, their message is still the same.
They find that there have been some inconsistencies in the electoral process.
They think that it is not honest, and they have said that they intend to stay here, even in small groups, until all votes have been counted and the trials and various legal disputes have taken place.
The mood here is a little calmer than it was a few days ago, but as you may hear, there are still people shouting.
Supporters of Joe Biden are yelling something at Trump's supporters, and they are shouting back, but in fact, a little bit of this tension has been relieved.
Thank you, Maria-Ann, European leaders congratulated the next President of the United States, Joe Biden.
According to both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, Biden will be faced with great challenges.
European leaders sent their sincere congratulations to Joe Biden last night.
As it is currently used, several leaders did this via Twitter.
Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany wished Biden luck and success, while she congratulated separately Kamala Harris, the first female US Vice President.
According to Merkel, transatlantic cooperation is essential to meet the great challenges of our time.
According to Emmanuel Macron, President of France, Europe and the United States must work hard to meet today's challenges.
Also Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, spoke about the great challenges in her congratulatory message.
It is noteworthy that European leaders congratulated Biden in a coordinated manner around 8 o'clock the Estonian time yesterday in order to avoid the possible resentment of their current President, Donald Trump.
Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General also congratulated Biden and the Vice President Harris on his behalf.
According to Stoltenberg, he knows Biden as a great supporter of NATO and is already looking forward to working with him.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson was also very positive about Biden's triumph.
Martin Helme, Estonian Minister of Finance and Chairman of EKRE and Mart Helme, Minister of the Interior expressed doubts about the honesty of the US presidential election in today's radio broadcast, implying that President Donald Trump lost the election due to counterfeiting.
Mart Helme said Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, are corrupt and there is a deep state behind Biden's victory.
Consequently, PM Jüri Ratas made a Facebook post, condemning the statements of the two Helmes.
Martin Helme, as the leader of a party and the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Estonia, must understand that the USA is our greatest ally and an irreplaceable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union.
As the Minister of the Interior, Mart Helme should also know very well that making serious accusations without evidence is inadmissible, the PM Ratas wrote.
President Kersti Kaljulaid intends to convene the National Defense Council in the coming days in connection with today's statements by the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance.
Most security experts of the Estonian political parties believe that Joe Biden's foreign policy is favourable for our region.
I believe that this inherent position of the United States to oppose the Russian aggression and to continue to keep in place the sanctions will be maintained, and we can certainly bear in mind that Biden's previous steps, including his rhetoric in the election campaign, are such that he certainly attaches importance to protecting the Baltics and the capabilities of NATO.
I do not think that there will be any major changes in the relationship between the USA and Estonia, which has always been good traditionally, no matter from which party the president is. 
The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has the opportunity to restore its reputation as a reliable ally and as a reliable world leader.
Certainly, it is the revenge of the old Washington elites, because they collected huge sums against Trump.
It is said that the amount of four times was staked.
George Soros promised to overthrow Trump a long time ago.
Bloomberg invested a humungous amount of money against Trump.
After all, Trump promised to go and air out old Washington elites.
The most important topic for us is security.
And for us, America is the number one ally, and I think both Trump and Biden are very good allies for us in terms of security.
It is also very worrying that if, like the Trump's so-called use of language, that now the Communists are in power again or something like that, and if such labelling continues, or that Biden has won, as if by lying or falsifying the election results, that people will go along with this, also among other people, here by the leading politicians of our government party, it will certainly not work in the interests of the relationship between Estonia and the United States.
Additional one hundred and ninety-two coronavirus carriers were identified in Estonia in the past twenty-four hours, two thousand one hundred and nineteen tests were performed.
The fourteen-day notification rate of new cases per a hundred thousand inhabitants is one hundred and twenty-nine, and the share of tests returning a positive result is six and a half percent.
According to the population register, the highest number of infected persons, that is, additional ninety persons, was registered in Harju County and sixty-nine in Ida-Viru County.
Significantly less persons were registered in other counties.
As of this morning, the hospital has fifty-five Covid-19 patients and four people are being ventilated.
Yesterday, two people died of coronavirus, a woman aged eighty-seven and a woman aged seventy-five.
In a gratitude speech at the Estonia Concert Hall, Arvo Tuvikene, the father of the year, drew the attention of politicians to how to keep life going in the Estonian rural areas.
Arvo Tuvikene, a father of four, is one of the most famous ichthyologists in Estonia.
long days, there are only twenty-four hours in a day, not one more.
How nice it is, when good fathers have good children to become the maintainers of the household.
In his Father's Day speech, PM Jüri Ratas talked about the luck of being able to ask one’s father or grandfather for advice and words of wisdom.
Ratas added that it is important to think about all those who have not had a father with whom to become friends.
it is our duty as a society, to work wholeheartedly to ensure that they, too, would always feel the care, support and understanding of all of us in everyday life, in politics and in our activities.
Arvo Tuvikene, a scientist who won the title of the Father of the Year and who is a father of four, is just the kind of a man who shares warmth with everyone.
He is praised by family members, friends, colleagues and mentees.
Mikk, his son says that his father is a role model for fathers, having encouraged his children to act and make decisions, but also [the one who has] taught them to take the responsibility.
He is a very kind, a very, very generous person, being also a very interesting person, thus his stories are very interesting to listen to.
Arvo Tuvikene, the father of the year, has been doing research for forty-three years.
In addition, he is keen on promoting science and he plays the first clarinet in the wind orchestra of Tartu and the orchestra of the Elva Music School.
The time left over from children is for making music and promoting and doing research.
We asked the father of the year what advice he would give to those who have just become fathers.
A crucial thing is to be interested in the activities of your children and the trends they are following and another important thing is to love and respect your children's mother and let it be clear to the children.
Arvo Tuvikene said in his gratitude speech that he has lived in the periphery for the most part of his life and he has been happy there.
Thus, he wants to draw the attention of the state and local government leaders to the need to sustain and increase the quality of life in rural areas.
To this end, rural schools should be kept open, as schools are a cornerstone of local communities, he added.
no, it is not, then of course the children leave the area and it is no secret that the parents will follow.
High-speed internet must also reach forest farms in order to keep alive the countryside, Arvo Tuvikene added.
As calmly as now, the residents of Tallinn Old Town have probably not been able to sleep for years.
Fear of the coronavirus and a restriction on the sale of alcohol starting at midnight have deterred the partygoers away from the party streets of the Old Town.
It is now eleven o’clock on Saturday evening and it should be the time when the capital's wildest parties are on, because the sale of alcohol will be banned in an hour.
We are on Suur-Karja Street, which should be one of the favourite streets of Tallinn's partygoers, only that the street is there, lying on its place, but the partygoers are gone.
According to Yuri who came to have fun in the Old Town on Saturday night, the fear of the coronavirus has scared away the partygoers.
If you one was used to meet up with friends there, now people are drinking at home.
Only gangs of young people continue to hang in Musumäe hill as before.
Have a look, nothing is going on.
It is really sad that the nightlife of the Old Town is dying.
Ravis has been watching the weekend nightlife of Tallinn for three months while staying near the Old Town, and if the clock strikes midnight, the beer taps are turned off and the parties are over.
According to Yuri, the Old Town is so frustratingly empty that when he was trying to gift white roses to the women passing by on Saturday night, there was so little movement on Viru Street that in an hour and a half he managed to give away eight of the twenty roses.
According to Maksim Sokolov, the owner of the hookah bar, on the one hand, understands the purpose of the restrictions, but they have dealt with a serious blow to both the turnover as well as the number of visitors.
According to Jevgeni, a taxi driver waiting for clients at the Hollywood nightclub around midnight, the nightlife died out from the Old Town as soon as the restriction on the night-time sale of alcohol was imposed.
Since then, taxi drivers are doing anything but well.
That Friday, he was at work from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and he had only four clients.
The Old Town is not completely died out yet.
As if there was some bustle, but no hustle.
The week will soon be over, so let's have a look what were the most important events.
My experience in the field of environment has been very intense during my time as an advisor, with all the issues related to the Ministry of the Environment and the environment being on my table.
In the Ministry of Finance as an advisor to the Minister of Finance.
The situation in Estonia is critical and we are moving very clearly towards a health care crisis.
Next week, the Social Affairs Committee of the Parliament will discuss the Psychiatric Care Act again.
Psychiatrists are the only specialists to whom a child under the age of 18 needs parental consent to access.
Specialists involved in the work of the commission have repeatedly highlighted the need to amend the law.
Ave Häkli investigated why the amendment has stalled in the Parliament.
A gap the law does not allow young people under the age of 18 to seek psychiatric help without a parental consent.
Although the authorities have repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without any help each month.
Young people should always be able to seek help for themselves, regardless of what their family members think, or in other words, the mistrust of help-seeking in the event of mental health problems has not disappeared from all families.
The current law is also largely based on the situation that all children have supportive parents, a functioning family who can then support their child and make decisions for him or her.
Unfortunately, in my work and practice, I see that sadly this situation is different, that all parents either do not know or for some reason do not want to deal with their child's issue, if they may not have the necessary skills, need help or even they themselves are the cause of their child's problems.
The topic has been discussed six times in the Social Affairs Committee of the Parliament.
Various aspects of the problem have been explained by specialists.
Representatives of thirty-six organisations also signed a joint appeal justifying the importance of the legislative amendment.
It has been a year and a half since the Chancellor of Justice brought to the attention of the country the fact that this small legislative amendment would be fair and necessary for young people.
Today, we are in a situation where the Social Affairs Committee of the Parliament has been dealing with this issue for almost a year, including the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Affairs, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Social Affairs, who have bluntly spoken out in favour of this legislative amendment.
And we go on discussing it, but still haven’t settled the discussion.
What at first seemed like a small and simple legislative amendment has grown into a fundamental confrontation.
Urmas Espenberg, a member of the Social Affairs Committee and a member of Estonian Conservative People's Party (EKRE) says that in theory, they agree that young people could exceptionally have access to a psychiatrist without parental consent.
In practice, they have not reached an agreement.
According to Espenberg, two exceptional cases in which a young person could turn to a psychiatrist without a parental consent are the lack of a guardian and domestic violence.
Certainly, I do not agree with the fact that everyone will voluntarily start rushing to psychiatrists, so that each random child [could go to a psychiatrist]; let them see a psychologist first and the psychologist then will see whether [to proceed or] what to do next.
So what are those who oppose the legislative amendment afraid of, are they not trusting young people or [not trusting] specialists or in other words, psychiatrists?
Espenberg cites among the main reasons the need to collaborate with the family the concern that young people will be prescribed medicines that are too strong.
But there are also fears that mental issues will become a fashion disease or that young people will resell prescribed medicines on the black market.
After all, young people are prone to try all sorts of things, and when it comes down to everyone being allowed to do it, the word gets out about antidepressants.
They probably may start selling them [the medicines] to each other.
The psychiatrist contests the fears of those who oppose the legislative amendment.
It is the doctor's job and within his or her competence to assess the condition of the patient and act accordingly.
It is always the doctor's wisdom to see through these situations, what are the motives people actually visit and how such use of the medicine is intended, or in other words, there are rules by following which we prevent most of these challenges.
According to both specialists and youth workers, the problem is serious and needs to be addressed.
I approached thirteen youth workers from four different youth institutions and one third of them have actually been encountered the issue of the child needing psychiatric therapy, but the therapy has not been seeked due to parents’ opposition.
also stories.
Sometimes, the stories are daunting, to put it in mild terms.
Two of these stories led to suicide attempts, that were fortunately unsuccessful, one of which is an ongoing process where namely, the child does not have the courage to reach out to his or her parents, insofar as his or her parents are strongly convinced that mental health issues are something that is only for the insane or severely mentally ill.
Urmas Espenberg proposes a solution that another adult who comes into contact with young people would be allowed to refer or provide a written consent to see a psychiatrist.
it looks like this that we have all kinds of networks, there is a youth and child protection network, then there is the same police where certain cases are reported and they can refer them there immediately, then there are school psychologists who can be contacted.
There are many of these opportunities, there are many psychologists in Estonia and their resources are all relatively untapped.
So, that here we should think of a some kind of a solution to these things and not to blame each other here.
Nevertheless, each intermediate stage makes the bureaucracy grow and requires [the employment] of additional human resources.
At the moment, the challenge is to meet the existing requirements.
Only thirty-nine percent of the Estonian schools have a employed a psychologist.
This means that more than half of the schools have to cope without [the presence of] a psychologist.
In schools where they are present, they are doing their job very well, and in places where they lack, their absence is felt strongly.
What happens if people do not receive help on time?
Well, in the the event of mental disorders, one of the most common examples of which is depression, there is a very high risk that it will become chronic.
But before it becomes chronic, it reduces one’s quality of life, that is, that young people are unable to learn, to communicate, to personally fulfil themselves.
And they deviate from daily life, or in other words, they go home, sit at the computer at the beginning, soon they will no longer even sit there anymore, but instead, lie down in bed or have something to eat at best.
They have completely lost hope and are only thinking that the only solution would be to die.
The number of people infected with the coronavirus exceeded two hundred persons on several days this week, and Tanel Kiik, Minister of Social Affairs said on Friday that due to the spread of the coronavirus, Estonia is on its way to a health care crisis.
Hanneli Rudi reports on how the virus is now spreading.
Two hundred and eight, one hundred and thirty-one, two hundred and forty-one.
These are not victory points in a game, like darts, but instead they are the numbers of people infected with the coronavirus this week.
Kind of sad record numbers, aren’t they?
However, in the middle of October, Estonia still stood out in terms of exceptionally low infection rates in Europe.
Now, however, it is no longer possible to identify the source of infection in every other patient in Tallinn and Harju County, i.e. the disease has started to spread covertly.
I cannot say if it was really predictable, but anyhow, the coronavirus is [a virus] that doesn't always grow evenly, but rather this disease that is transmitted as foci that spread exponentially.
Does it mean that it went out of control, I would not dare to say surely yet, but the growth rate is of course not the nicest thing and we could manage to get this growth rate under control, because at such a growth rate we certainly will not handle the situation until the spring with flying colours.
According to Maarja Kadastik, compiler of coronavirus charts, such a rapid increase in morbidity is expected, because the infection rate “r”, which shows to how many people the sick person passes on the virus, has stayed between one point two and one point four for the last few weeks.
By Saturday, the number had risen to one point five, meaning that two sick people passed the infection on to three people.
Even if the infection rate did not increase, it would be a serious threat to the Estonian health care system, because in that case, hospitals would be filled with COVID-19 patients by the end of the year.
Although there has been a lot of talk regarding the Covid nineteen about whether the ventilators will be enough for everybody, Kadastik says that the whole medical system will be in a serious crisis.
If we run out of Covid beds, we will have to distribute them to other places, because we cannot place Covid patients and regular patients together.
And if this system now goes completely out of hand, as it has been in some parts of the world, where hospitals are full of Covid patients, the problem is that we can no longer treat other diseases that are very treatable.
The Covid departments also need much more staff and therefore it is not possible to endlessly increase bed capacity.
According to Kadastik, it is worth trying to get the situation under control before the critical limit is reached.
In his estimation, the current numbers reflect rather the initial phase of the “tsunami” of COVID-19 rather than the spread of the disease in waves.
It remains so until the Health Board will trace most of the contacts.
Well, we have been walking on the edge for a long time and our inspectors from the Northern Regional Department are doing a great work, giving their best.
Of course, the involvement of the chatbot helped a lot.
The chatbot lectures the close contacts, but life has shown that this is not enough, because often the message given by the chatbot is not understood.
Thus, the so-called corona detectives working in Tallinn have received about a dozen external assistants, who are calling people additionally.
Corona detectives from other regions have also come to help.
Could it also be the case that they simply throw in the towel and give up looking for any close contacts, or is this scenario completely ruled out?
This scenario is entirely plausible if we cannot control the disease, right.
And what is very important now is that we all did the right thing, because at the moment everything is in our hands.
According to Kadastik, when the force of corona detectives fails, there will be no escape from the implementation of general restrictions.
In the case of any exponential growth, the longer this growth is, the more difficult it is to eliminate this situation, or in other words, the sooner we get a grip on this situation, the more effortlessly we can handle this.
Kadastik recommends avoiding eye-to-eye contact as much as possible, keeping a distance from strangers, and if this is not possible, using a mask.
According to the scientist, it is worth remembering that the result of today's actions or restrictions will be reflected in the statistics on the coronavirus only in two to four weeks.
The Scientific Council, which advises the government, has already made recommendations for the restrictions.
Instead of restoring the “two plus two” rule, they simply suggested keeping a two-metre distance.
The closing of bars or nightlife, yes, we recommended it, or bringing it down to zero, but nobody is telling anyone not to put on a mask in closed rooms right now, so please, people, put on a mask, is it really Jüri Ratas who has to tell you that?
Let's go ahead now and see how many of us can be affected by one infected person.
The Health Board described to us an actual case of an outbreak of the virus, where there were an extraordinary number of close contacts.
Half a thousand people were isolated, many of whom had to stop working for two weeks.
There was a father who was at the centre of the case, since the virus travelled to Estonia with a father who had been abroad.
The father, who arrived home, infected his wife, his son, his son's partner, his two daughters and the daughter's child.
The infected mother worked in a social welfare institution, where she came into contact with ninety-five people.
Her close contacts underwent a test twice, none of whom became ill.
After the son, working in a large team, came into contact  with several persons, one co-worker fell ill and three hundred and sixty-five close contacts became monitored, none of them fell ill.
That infected co-worker brought the infection to his home and five people in his family became infected.
The son's partner worked in a canteen that was closed and fourteen contacts were sent to isolate.
Fortunately, none of them became ill.
The daughter, a school student, had twenty-one close contacts, all of whom were sent home to isolate.
None of them became ill.
The kindergarten that the daughter's child attended, was closed and fourteen close contacts were monitored, none of them fell ill.
To boot, there were eighteen family members isolating who did not fall ill and thirteen people became infected as a result of the outbreak, while five hundred and twenty-seven people were in close contact during the two-week isolation and they were monitored by the Health Board.
As this week's news programmes focused on observing the US presidential election, our correspondents asked the Estonian people whom they would have preferred to fill this position?
Which one do you prefer, Trump or Biden?
I think that the newer the better, even though [he is] older, but still the new one, Biden.
Generally, I am neutral, but if [you ask me], rather, I am not a sympathiser of none of them but if I had to choose between the two bad choices, then I would rather pick Biden.
Trump.
Why?
Why Trump?
I do not know the other president.
Maybe it could be Biden.
Why?
Trump has already been a president, then there would simply be a change.
At the moment, I have not thought through the answer for myself, but we will see, what the future brings.
I think Biden.
But why?
Well, he is a democrat and his views seem more in line with mine.
I don’t like this Trump very much, so...
So, regarding Trump, there have been something that you do not like?
Well, many things...
that I can see reflect also in our politics, so...
The main concern for me, after all, is that both of them are relatively old people, so I ask myself, how are they going to endure in this hard work and tough position.
Well, I still think [that I would choose] Biden, so we hope the situation will get a little calmer then.
Biden, certainly.
But why?
I don’t know, I don’t like Trump.
Well, don’t ask me, but Trump was such a fierce guy, right.
It makes no difference, who they are, I don’t care.
This year, the year of digital culture, the foundation for the Estonian audiobook market was established.
If, for example, while in Sweden, digital and audio books already hold almost half of the volume of the market of fiction, in Estonia, we are only taking the first steps on this path.
Reet Veidebaum reports on the making of audio books.
This spring, the National Library launched a public procurement, by which audio books of fifty Estonian authors’ works were ordered.
The publishing houses Pegasus, Eesti Raamat, and Hea lugu created a common platform, Digiread, where audio books in Estonian will be available as of August.
Well, at the moment, we are reaching the first hundred books and more precisely, of which almost seventy of them are of the Estonian literature and the rest is translated literature that in total, as I checked this morning, sums up to six hundred and fifty hours.
Thus, it is about twenty days of audio books.
In fact, statistics from the rest of the world show that rather so-called easy genres are popular, i.e. leisure literature, crime stories, action books and as always, also works by some certain local authors.
Among others, Indrek Hargla's “Apothecary Melchior” ("Apteeker Melchior") and "The Mystery of St Olaf's Church" (“Oleviste mõistatus”), Andrus Kivirähk’s "Stories" (“Lood”), Priit Kuuse's “Ship cook Wend” ("Laevakokk Vend") and Armin Kõomägi's "Lui Vutoon" are among the most popular ones in Estonia.
Most of the time, the authors have a fairly definite vision of the people who could read their books.
There was just an unknown man standing on the slate, xxx.
How can one place be so peaceful and at the same time so haunting?
This summer, Jan Uuspõld read Mihkel Mutt's "The International Man" (“Rahvusvaheline mees”), Andrus Kivirähk's "Stories" (“Lood”) and Jaan Kaplinski's “The Swift´s Travels” (“Piirpääsukese Euroopa”).
Reading the audiobook was the first experience for me, I have read a bit of serials on the radio beforehand, but reading the whole book is new for me.
Of course, this opportunity came at a time when there was nothing to do but to sit at home, and it was so nice that there was a chance to do something.
It's so scary, I don't have the courage to continue reading it.
A little, to be honest, I must say, the voice or knee or... it shook pretty hard in Kaplinski's case.
So, I read his “The Swift´s Travels”, I can say frankly, at some point I was wondering what I would do then, whether to interrupt all and say that I could do that.
Because okay, I’m more or less familiar with maybe the Polish pronunciation, Russian, Nordic languages, Finnish and Swedish, well, Finnish of course, but Swedish... when he started to go towards the Irish and when he threw in the Celtic and Gaelic, these expressions, where should I possibly have found these pronunciations?
Well in the end I got it done, I remember a morning where I thought, oh, so I guess these Gaelic and Irish parts were over, but then we ended up in France.
Well, today I set my goal to read twenty pages and today, I am going to read the way that I chill out and read the way it comes, I introduced myself a bit to the French pronunciation and then it came, here you are.
Hamlet's monologue in French from there loomed at me.
What will you do, then?
Well, I lost half a day again to somehow get right more or less.
Well, I don't know, I haven't dared to give it a listen yet.
A starter package has now been developed for reading digital books, and a mobile app should be ready by mid-December.
definitely, there will be more comfort features, meaning that one can also leave bookmarks and can conveniently scroll fifteen seconds or thirty seconds back if you one needs to listen to anything.
After that, there are sleep timers and all such comfort functions which only make the listening more enjoyable.
Ott Nool talks about the weather of the upcoming week.
Good evening.
It is gradually getting colder outside, as tomorrow the high-pressure system will dominate the Baltic Sea region, the centre of which will be above Poland and along the edge of the high-pressure system, the colder wind arrives in the Baltics and in Finland, which means that the thermometer readings will fall below zero in the internal areas the following night and there is a slip risk on the roads.
Tomorrow, a low-pressure system with no cyclonic development, which is heading from Finland towards the South-East, crossing Estonia, will also use this edge of the high-pressure system to move on, bringing light rain to North Estonia.
On Tuesday, the low-pressure front will move away to Russia and the high-pressure front will cover the Baltic Sea countries.
However, there is humidity here as well, and typical of autumn, the high-pressure system does not always mean sunshine.
At night, it’s partly cloudy and there are showers in some coastal areas.
There is west wind from two to seven [metres per second], on the coast, in gusts of eleven metres per second.
The temperature is between minus two and plus three, or five degrees in some places on the coast.
The morning will mostly be cloudy, but the sky will be clearer in the South-Eastern Estonia.
It rains mainly in the coastal areas and the South-West wind blows between three to eight [metres per second], with gusts of twelve metres per second, on the North coast there is also the North-West winds of seven to twelve [metres per second], with gusts of sixteen metres per second.
Also in the morning, the temperature can drop below zero in some places and the temperature is expected o be between minus one to plus five, on the coast up to eight degrees.
It will rain a little during the day and the probability of precipitation will decrease in the afternoon.
There will be South-West and West wind between five to twelve [metres per second], in gusts of fifteen metres per second.
There will be five to ten degrees above zero.
Tuesday promises to be clearer, but on Wednesday it will get a little rainier, and the week will be similar.
The air temperature is lower than at the end of the week, with an average temperature varying between zero and four at night, and five to seven degrees are expected during the day.
The days are getting shorter and shorter and the cool air is quietly sneaking around.
Have a good evening.
Americans stood in long queues of voters and the spirits were kept up, for example, by dancing.
At a polling station in Philadelphia, we managed to record a voting dance performed by a ninety-year-old lady on a cell phone camera.
[Good] evening to you all.
In today’s foreign news, we will show you, among other things, the world’s oldest professional footballer and a house that was mounted on legs.
We start today’s foreign news with a report on a house that has, literally, stood on its own legs.
Such a miracle was achieved in Shanghai, China, where a five-story school building, weighing 7,600 tons, was mounted on 198 robotic legs and was ‘walked’ for exactly 61.7 meters.
This was done to preserve the school building, built in 1935, as otherwise it would have been demolished due to a new construction project.
Ethiopia is struggling with a real scourge, with an infestation of locusts on a scale that has not been seen for 25 years, but now locust swarms are encircling there since January, having damaged 200,000 hectares worth of crops in this period.
The region already had enough problems with food supply due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But with the addition of locusts, with swarms of one square kilometers in size that can devour as much food as 35,000 people in a day, there are serious consequences.
The locals are now hoping for aid from the government and the UN.
Do you remember the energetic 100-year-old Brit, Captain Tom Moore, who raised an enormous amount, more than 33m euros, for charity by walking in his garden, and was knighted for this?
Now, we present the 80-year-old retired major Michael Stanley who, inspired by him, intends to row 100 miles, or 160 kilometers, in a homemade boat.
He rows for approximately 5km at a time, which takes the old gent about 90 minutes.
He makes two such outings per week.
By now, he has raised nearly 13,000 euros, which he intends to donate to the local hospital.
We will continue with industrious men.
This is Ezzeldin Bahader who lives in Egypt, is a father of four children and a grandfather, and he plays football in the Egyptian third division.
Even though he missed a penalty in the last game and his team lost two to three, the old man who will be 75 years on 3 November, had more than enough reason to be joyful.
Namely, Ezzeldin became the world’s oldest professional footballer and his achievement was entered in the Guinness Book of World Records.
We conclude with panda news.
In the Smithsonian Zoo, the United States, the mother Mei Xiang brought her eight-week cub out of the nest to see the world for the first time.
However, the tiny panda, who could still only strengthen its muscles by crawling, did not have too long to wonder around, because its mother took it quickly back to the nest.
There was an excellent question in a pub quiz in Tartu that caught our eye.
Namely, it concerns the Hungarian language and this is what we are going to talk about.
You are so excited.
I understand.
Once again, when you start introducing something and extremely excited, this is really a quiz.
Indeed, this is a quiz but you, dear TV viewers, can play along with us. So look at the quiz and be much better than us, but I do have a major advantage, because I have served in the Soviet army.
However, the advantage is not that, but that I served in Hungary and have very personal experience with the Hungarian language.
And my advantage is that I have shared a room with you for many years.
I know vez, gez.
That’s right, mez means honey, vez means water and gez means hand in Hungarian and, by the way, sarv means sarv, so that there is one word that is exactly the same.
Now then, the idea of our game is – by the way, pharmacy is another word that was even impossible to read in Hungarian; of course, there are no more similarities with the Hungarian language.
But now, what is this?
The idea of the game is that you can see here five countries and, as I understand it, these are European countries, aren’t they?
Yes, European; we have a map of the European Union in front of us and these are then five European countries, in Hungarian.
It looks like they simply had a bunch of letters left over and they assembled them and[...]
And we now have to guess the countries, between us.
But, you see, one of those is different; otherwise they all have zak; let’s assume that szag means land, but Lengyel[...]
Why do you think that there’s no Estonia here?
I don’t believe that they have a special expression for Estonia.
I know the logic; we can guess it from the fact that, you see, nearby countries have their own special words; we are Viromaa for the Finns and Igaunia for the Latvians, but Estonia is so far.
There, in Hungary, they don’t even know that Estonia exists.
it is.
We are related.
I have lived in Hungary for a year.
I have told them that we in Estonia have a related language.
They fall down.
Nobody has heard or seen anything about it.
So this is not at all the case.
I think that these are nearby countries.
But Görögorszag is Greece, this is, like, certain.
You don’t object, do you?
No, I don’t object.
Görögorszag is Greece.
Feherororszag.
Which one do we choose then?
Which seems more likely to you?
You were so certain about Germany that you have now convinced me that it is Germany.
It is Germany.
Ok, we know two.
Now, we have Egyesült, it seems to consist of two words.
It did not help, this pronunciation; the correct pronunciation did not help us, but we’ve got this.
Let’s see then.
Ok, fine, we here will continue learning Hungarian, while you can watch how Marko visited a place where, I believe, none of you, or perhaps only very few of you have been.
We are actually as close to the Tallinn city center as one can possibly be, but I believe many of you have never noticed the stained glass behind these very same windows.
What you see here is actually stained glass windows of Freemasons and the place where we will go with our camera is somewhere where nobody else has been with a camera; this is the first time they allow entrance to a TV camera.
What exactly are they doing, what kind of rituals are performed here and why is it all so mysterious?
This is what we are trying to find out.
Welcome!
Well, the door is open. It is not like this every day, but because we have actually made this appointment in advance.
But not everyone is permitted to enter the temple.
We are greeted by Master Paul Himma.
This is where we live. This has been our home, these premises here, actually this floor, for the past eight years.
Before that, we used rental premises around Tallinn and hauled our staff.
We would build a hall, and then take it down.
Yes, this is our first home.
Let’s go and look at the temples, if it is all right with you?
It is very much all right with me. But isn’t the temple a secretive, mysterious place that you cannot, in principle, enter just like that, or enter at all?
Do you really think that something can be a secret in the 21st century? A secret is something that is inside someone’s head. As soon as two people know about it, it is no longer a secret.
Why are Freemasons so keen to keep this secret?
Do I keep a secret?
I don’t know, this is the impression one gets.
But why is there this impression?
People believe what they want to believe and, if you look, even now there are all kinds of conspiracy theories and people believe in whatever, flat earth or that there is a larger earth inside this one, which is the outer one, and so on and so forth.
Obviously, there are plenty of conspiracy theories around Freemasons.
One of their best-known symbols is the all-seeing eye, which is featured, for example, on the US one dollar bill, but also on the Estonian 50 kroons note.
The talk of Freemasons’ so-called secret world governance does not seem to die down.
In fact, it is not even clear how the organization began. According to the prevalent theory, it developed from associations of master builders, which were called ‘lodges’ in England.
The official date of founding is June 24, 1717, when the first Grand Lodge was established from four lodges.
It is estimated that today, there are six million Freemasons worldwide.
There are many famous people, both living and dead, among them.
For example, US President George Washington and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but also writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe.
Konstantin Päts was, arguably, also a Freemason.
We will soon talk about the current members.
But now, time has come to enter the temple.
This is the waiting room before entering the meeting. Here are[...] well, we can also take a look. Here are a couple of meditation rooms, so that those who are invited and elected would have an opportunity to sit here for a while and reflect. The candle will be lit. Here is another such place of reflection.
You can also sit here, so think about life here.
Does anyone actually come here to sit and meditate?
But always, before the one who is invited and elected comes here, before anything at all begins, they would sit here.
What would they do here, perhaps they are on their phone.
Think.
Well, it is bad with phones everywhere, but generally people are not on their phones here.
This is a completely new house but, you see, on the inside it still looks like a Christian chamber or, indeed, like a watch chamber.
Yes, this ethics, and this moral education and all that, is indeed based on Biblical stories through[...] and on Ancient Greek philosophy, and the rituals of the Grand Orient, they are based on Ancient Egyptian philosophy.
On the one hand, it seems usual that there are chairs and tables, but on the other hand, I still feel a little unusual here, with all these symbols and signs and such.
They originate from the tradition of England and, indeed, knowing England, they even have village elders wearing fancier chains of office than perhaps our highest officials. In this sense, in the Estonian context, it does indeed seem a little excessive or whatever, but it is tradition.
This is how it has been for nearly 300 years.
And it will likely continue so. And here I simply brought – these are my aprons that I brought. This is the collar and apron of a past Deputy Grand Master and this is one, in blue, of a past Master, mine, that I wear every day.
Can you put it on for a moment?
I cannot put it on, because I have the wrong clothes, but I say that I will hold it in my hands, because otherwise I would have to wear different clothes.
Are these chairs also a kind of sacred, so that when I am, like, heretic from the Freemasons’ perspective, can I sit on it or is it absolutely prohibited?
Now, look closely as I sit on a chair in the Freemasons’ temple.
Yes, if you[...]
What happened to me now?
Well, you became wiser.
You can also lie down if you like.
Does really nothing happen?
Of course it doesn’t.
Isn’t a temple a place where – well, I don’t known – we go, like a church is a temple as well, isn’t it?
Isn’t it in some sense like a sanctuary?
Of course it is. The questions is about the stance that you sit in that chair with, and if you are[...] if you have internal respect for it and you take it seriously, then it is also no sacr[...]
I have a keen interest in this.
Yes, that is quite enough.
Here is an office-holder who is a watchman.
Obviously, it has remained from the old times, but it is symbolic. He should keep watch so that people who have no business here would not enter during the meeting.
May I touch it?
Of course you may.
Take care not to drop it.
I will try.
Oh, dear, this is a real Masonic sword, you see, on this door.
Has it ever been necessary to actually use this sword to fend someone off?
No, we are very much in a world of symbols and allegories and obviously it has never been prac[...] and I think nobody even knows how to use it.
Now, for the first time ever, cameras will enter this blue hall of the Masonic temple.
Welcome!
I say that, wow, it is in fact impressive, it is not really an ordinary room or a usual place that we[...] like an ordinary office room which we are accustomed to.
It is actually something quite different.
Well, if you have spent the entire day in an office, you would not want to come to an office in the evening as well. It should be something uplifting, And this room is then[...] here on the ceiling you can see the constellation of the stars on the day when this lodge was consecrated, which is now eight years ago.
Paul Himma was for a long time Director General of the Estonian National Opera and also a deputy director of Estonian Radio for many, many years, which is why we are addressing each other informally, because we have known each other for, well, a score and even more than a score of years.
This seems like a very important place, and here is an important place and also here is an important place, so that when I’m looking at it as an outsider, it seems to me that three important people can be here?
Different offices have different roles and indeed if an honorable Master is sitting towards the east, it means that this is a man who has been prepared to serve the brotherhood and the ideals perhaps in the most committed way. But, Marko, would you maybe like to take a seat for a moment?
Am I allowed to sit there?
Well, why not?
I don’t know, it all seems so[...]
The earth will not swallow you anyway.
I am now sitting on a very remarkable spot where I have never sat before in my life and, who knows, perhaps will never happen to sit again.
That is, on the most important chair of the Masonic temple, and I don’t even know, when I look at this object that is here at hand, I honestly cannot even understand what is this thing.
Like, a meeting, adopting decisions or an agenda, you knock it, yes.
This is a drawing desk and here will be placed the agenda of the meeting for that day and then, ritual work can also begin.
‘Ritual’ means that – as I say, as someone who has had a little experience with theatre – I would say that it is like performing a miniature play. There are really so many symbols here and so[...]
This is the Marshal.
He is the director of ceremonies because, as I said, the special costume and these regalia are one thing, but this ritual, this play also involves movement or we can even call it – even though nobody is exactly dancing – it can also be called choreography.
Each grade has, like, a focus on which it concentrates in this moral education and this is, kind of, in two ways.
We, all the office-holders who are performing and enacting it, for us it is like rehearsal – that rehearsal is the mother of wisdom – but we are doing it. The so-called audience is a single person, one who has been invited and elected and is being elevated that evening. It is for him. And he also enters with eyes closed at first, it is a surprise for him.
What do you actually do here? For instance, what is being discussed?
Nothing is being discussed in the sense that it is either performance of ritual work, it can be preceded by voting; then there can be some announcements and, at the end, there can be greetings, if any.
If there are any guests from other lodges.
So this is essentially a room for rituals?
Only ritual.
I can see, here is another very strange item.
What is it then? I have also never seen anything like that.
This is how voting was done in the old days.
When all had gone and voted, the Master would inspect what was inside and if it was black, then it was denied.
So you also then have a voting system; it is not that if someone has a wrong opinion his head would be cut off; there was that sword at the door.
What are you talking about?
How could I, for instance, become a Freemason if I wanted to?
Well, first, you have to be interested in this thing and then we, in the brotherhood and among members, will ask, ‘Listen, this Jüri or Jaan has shown interest, does anybody know him, what kind of man is he?’
And always – well there are currently about 820 of us over Estonia[...]
Estonia is so small that there is always someone who knows, who says, ‘Oh yes, he is a nice lad, this form of moral education could be suitable for him.’
What’s here then, is it here, like[...]
This is the altar.
This is the Volume of Sacred Law.
All religions are equal.
If there are Jews in the lodge, there would be the Torah here; if there is a Muslim in the lodge, there would also be the Quran here.
These are all sacred books.
Who would be sitting here?
This is the seat of the Senior Warden.
Yes, and his sign is then[...] it means that when a meeting starts he would raise it up.
The pillar is raised.
Why must there be so much of this kind of cinema and regalia and such symbols? I don’t want to offend, but when one comes here, it does look to an outsider a little like – how to put it – Star Trek decorations.
Why is there so much of that?
Because this is the tradition.
It has been this way for over 300 years, because in 1717, when a few men gathered in the Goose and Gridiron tavern behind the temple cathedral and founded the English Grand Lodge, all of that already existed.
And I see no reason to change the tradition here.
Is it the case that men will always remain children, that grown men assemble and then, in a sense, play with such – I don’t know – childish things?
I don’t know if these are childish things; they may seem like that to someone but, in any case, for those who play it here, as you say, for them it is serious.
And here are portraits of the Grand Masters of Estonian Freemasons; for example, here is Arno Köörna, who is known as Rector of the University of Tartu.
Raido Rüütel is here.
Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu and the current Grand Master of Freemasons, since 2017, is Toomas Tõnise, and his portrait.
I understand that Freemasons are still a secret organization, in a way. While you want to say that it is much more in the public, these names and faces are not too often associated with it. Why are these portraits displayed here, like, publicly and why are you allowed to show them?
Because it is not secret.
And we are not a secret organization. If I try to compare it to something like Rotary or Lions or Round Table, then Masonry is an inward-facing organization.
We are so romantic and naive that we believe that the world can be made better.
The world can be made better, indeed, but the world can be made better not by me telling you what is wrong, but by trying to make myself better.
Yet, if I know[...]
And it is not something to be discussed on a village square.
We visited the blue temple hall, now we are going to the red temple hall. What is it, why red?
There, we encountered many Old Testament stories and legends, associated with, say, architecture and ancient philosophy; here, this is where the Biblical stories from the New Testament are told.
I must say that this, too, looks impressive. Are you also content with everything you have done?
We are content, yes, but it has become too small for us already. I would say that here in Tallinn we are so that we have difficulties finding vacant days, and in the summer[...] But in addition to Tallinn, there are sections of the association in Tartu, Viljandi, Pärnu, Haapsalu, Rakvere.
Where is the money coming from? Where do Freemasons get all that money?
We are financed from membership fees, perhaps from 50 or 60 euros to 120 euros.
There are also some among us whose means[...]
In a month or year?
Year. And we have been active for only 30 years and, therefore, we are relatively poor. We do have a foundation where we do a little charity work, but we Freemasons do not advertise that in any country, even though in old countries, England or somewhere, they support entire wards or departments.
I can see that there is this black curtain there. Can we take a look behind?
During this play, this so-called play, this room is divided in two, and a part happens on this side and a part on the other side, and on this side there is[...]
Of course you can see.
But this altar, it looks extraordinary after all.
But why shouldn’t it?
There is plenty of ordinary in life anyway.
How is the reputation of Freemasons?
Freemasons have this great conspiracy and they want to take over the entire world and governments report to Freemasons.
Does the Estonian government report to Estonian Freemasons?
I realize that it is not proper to answer a question with a question, but I would then say rhetorically: Can you, can we really imagine, and can the TV viewer imagine, that non-profit associations rule the world?
Even, alright, leaving that aside.
Even Russia does not rule the world, even China does not rule the world, even the USA does not rule the world.
The only ones in this day and age who could govern it would be those who have something scarce, who have information and the resources to process it.
If at all, we would come to Google and Amazon, Facebook.
They have the information.
When Freemasons emerged after the collapse of the so-called socialist bloc, there were attempts to turn it into some kind of political attribute, but they have all failed, because a party is a much more efficient place to be involved in politics than here. With whom would you do politics here if you have a ritual to perform?
We have been talking for a long time and have been shown the temples and all the things, but I’m not sure if I am any wiser now.
So you think there is a secret chamber somewhere?
I don’t know about that, but I don’t know if I understood what exactly it is that you do here.
We work on making ourselves better.
So that better[...] good men could become better men.
It seems incredible in this day and age; I know you’re not the only one who does not believe that someone would want that.
And Freemasons have collected a lot of such significant, historical items over the years.
As Freemasonry was banned in Estonia during the period of the Russian Empire, all these items were deposited in museum and, in the case of Estonia, in the Estonian History Museum.
But now, they all will be displayed to the public, for the first time ever, because this Saturday, the day after tomorrow, in the Great Guild building, that is in our Old Town, in the Estonian History Museum,
a large exhibition “Free Masons 250. Years of Freemasonry in Estonia” will be opened, and this nice apron with skulls will also be on display.
It is a museum artefact, made of sheepskin, originating from the 18th century, 1785.
So visit the History Museum as well.
() But, anyway, we will shortly come back to current political affairs, because Johannes Tralla is in the office of Aktuaalne Kaamera and, obviously, the government, isn’t it?
Well, good evening! Of course, we cannot ignore this nice government reconciliation process, but as the Prime Minister could not come to our live studio, colleague Toomas Sildam will help us explain what actually happened today.
But, naturally, we will have other topics as well.
We will talk about the creation of a credit register that would collect information on everyone’s loans, about changes in the book market, and about a level crossing that was created because of a constantly reappearing hole in a fence.
So, see you at nine.
In the meantime, more culture – “OP” is on air now.
But, of course, we will conclude with a continuation of the Hungarian language course, because we are now already at an advanced level.
Oh, indeed, and ‘Estonia’, ‘in Estonia’, we wrote it down.
We know it.
Now, we will learn ‘Estonia’ and Grete will recite it beautifully.
You’re preparing.
I’m preparing.
Grete is preparing.
We will see you also[...] Did you say “OP”?
I said “OP”, today, yes.
And we will see you tomorrow at seven but now, ‘Estonia’ in immaculate Hungarian.
Biographies of athletes are being written again and again, because they are interesting to read; what all they have done and how they all have fought and competed.
But it rarely happens that biographies are written about coaches.
Indeed, a book like Klopp “Bring the Noise”.
How special must this man be that a biography is written about him now, when he is at the top of the top.
Yes, it is a super book. I should say, to start with, that when I began to read the book at first, I immediately experienced a minor surprise, seeing that my good acquaintance Aet Süvari had translated it into Estonian. I have been with her in several football studios, but she never mentioned that she was translating this book about Klopp at the same time. So this was actually a nice surprise to start with.
Do you know that man in person? When did you meet?
Going back in time nearly 24 years, and it was in the year 96 when I first saw him. I was going to play in the second division of German Bundesliga, from Estonia, and at the moment when I arrived in that team, Jürgen Klopp was in fact injured. He had a very serious injury in footballing terms, breaking his cruciate ligament, and even the book talks about how he recovered from this cruciate ligament injury in three months.
Completely unprecedented.
It is usually estimated to take up to six months, and I can confirm that this man was ready for training three month after the injury, and I believe he played his first game somewhere around the three and a half month mark.
How good a footballer was he?
Well, in fact, the book gives a very good description of how he was the butt of the jokes; that his first touch went so long that the opponent always caught it; it means that he was not seen as a very technical player, actually.
But what he was absolutely top class in, was is head game; he is 1.93m tall, even a little taller than I.
But it was absolutely extreme, this skill of his, and the desire to win.
It was, like, something extraordinary and I saw it with my own eyes on the football pitch, and we can all see it today on the side of the pitch, as coaches.
But did you at that moment when he was still running after the ball, did you have a passing thought – well, in fact, many players probably think about the end of this kind of career as an athlete at some point – what would happen next? Becoming a coach is quite a logical choice.
That this man, this Klopp, he would be the one to make teams work so hard that they start to win?
Yes, I’m absolutely not surprised that he became a coach.
In fact, he was always a spiritual leader in the team. For instance, I can clearly recall a Christmas party in 96, when we had performed very well in the first half[...] We finished second and Jürgen Klopp held a speech there, and there were this kind of minor competitions and he actually did not like losing there, either.
So, he certainly had an aptitude for that, and he was 100% someone who was trusted by the coach.
So, it was apparent, in fact, that he had the aptitude.
As we have announced, we will find out, why Jürgen Klopp and Ragnar Klavan are on the same picture. See, like, here they are on the same picture, even embracing each other.
Klopp selected Klavan to play.
Naturally, it would perhaps be Ragnar Klavan who would, today here, be able to talk most about Klopp as a coach. But the picture clearly illustrates something that is also a consistent theme in the book – that he has an enormous sense of empathy; he can make all players play, because he is, well[...]
Obviously, he is not quite like a friend, but he creates such an atmosphere that all players love him. Even after they have left the club, they say nice words about Klopp, because he is honest, he doesn’t do anything behind your back. If there is something, it is time to part ways, he would tell it to the player.
Well, it is[...]
It is respected a lot and, let’s say, from his golden era, there in Dortmund where he won the league twice, and now later in Liverpool where he just recently won the league and won the Champions League, all these players talk about him, well, in superlatives, as do the club owners.
But when we look at these competitions and what he does there on the side of the pitch, he does not perhaps seem that friendly all the time, more like a hot-tempered kind of man.
Very expressive when we see[...] This is an image that I have actually seen, how he had roughly the same expression when he attacked a corner and then, in short, we would all run towards this ball in the same manner. He already gritted his teeth back then, and it is this kind of slightly crazy stare, isn’t it?
Exactly a moment later, he is this warm person with a very broad smile, and he himself admits that he is sometimes overwhelmed by emotions. And for instance, the Mainz club[...]
Here we can see the opposite situation now, yes[...]
That the Sports Director of the Mainz club back then, Christian Heidel, who was the one who took me into the club at that time, and when he gave Klopp this opportunity to work as a coach, he talked vividly about the time when they won the first game. And when a goal was scored, he said, he didn’t even know[...] That he was trying to see where Klopp was – Klopp was running somewhere, not even himself knowing where – and everyone was looking, where Klopp was, and he was essentially already somewhere in the stands[...] So, a very emotional person.
What type of players does he prefer? Do they need to be men who can think for themselves, or men who follow orders?
This again, as I have read the book, I know that he has never been able to get the absolute best in the world, except now in Liverpool. The same in Mainz and in Dortmund, for instance. He himself was bringing up these young players and there was one good chapter about how players were selected in Mainz at the time. When players came from the first division, and when those who came from there thought that they were some kind of star players, that they would now really get to play and pass the ball[...] The first thing that Klopp actually wants to know is whether a player is willing to run, whether a players is willing to do the work. Because Klopp’s tactics, the way how the team plays, is very intense and they always try put the opponent under a high press, to win the ball and attack immediately instead of retreating calmly, after losing the ball, to wait and see what the opponent would do.
We can say that it was he who started doing things this way in the early 2000s.
And it was, in fact, completely innovative in Germany as well, that this kind of lazy-asses cannot go and play in Klopp’s team.
Well, his contract with Liverpool runs until 2023, or something like that, which are the sweetest moments for this coach. He has collected a lot of those, the Champions League as well, right? So what else could be there; where else could it come?
Yes, and what is interesting is that he was in Mainz for seven years, and in Dortmund for seven years.
2015 he went to Liverpool and, let’s put it this way, he will take the first two or three years to make a result, and now that Liverpool are champions and he is a Champions League winner, he now has two more years to go.
So, when we go into numbers a little bit, he would have to move in 2022.
But the question is indeed, where would one go from there? I believe that he is the kind of man who could, one day, coach the German national team.
Excellent! Thank you for coming today and doing proper homework by reading the book, and I understand that Klopp “Bring the Noise”
has Lemsalu’s recommendation.
Absolutely, one hundred percent! Thank you for coming today!
One evening, she simply said that let’s divide the children.
Having raised five children alone, Madis leads a life that is as colorful as a soap opera, but he had no luck in love, until now.
This is the life I want to be in until my last breath.
Now, they have 11 children between them.
And now our guest is Kadri Kõusaar, who recently returned from Jordan where she is making her fourth feature-length film.
Why Jordan?
Because there is a splendid desert and I have dreamed about making this desert movie for over, let’s say, ten years now.
What kind of film is it? Its title is “Dead Woman”. It is really very difficult to make a movie about a dead woman.
If the woman is dead all the time, then you wouldn’t get much action showing her.
Well, it is more like this metaphor, this title, that maybe she is emotionally dead, for instance.
And then something happens to her in that desert that revives her. Perhaps we can interpret the title in this way.
But it is true that it is about a Swedish journalist who goes on an assignment
in Egypt and is, unfortunately, kidnapped.
But this kidnapping will then lead to an incredibly genuine romance.
How would you talk about Jordan? How is life there? Well, you were now[...] We wanted to invite you earlier, but you were in corona quarantine here in Estonia, because all who come from abroad need to remain in quarantine.
Now it is over for you.
How is life there in Jordan, in terms of Covid and in general?
Well, it is a country of the Middle-East, which means that there can be certain peculiarities, politically, and there are many sensitive areas.
But, in general, they have coped relatively well with the corona crisis. In the spring, they established a kind of military order, because people simply did not listen to the plea to stay at home.
No, we could not even go, because the whole world was locked down before that. But they had a military curfew and you were really only allowed to go to a grocery store or pharmacy. And if you broke the rules, you were put in a prison.
So, things were rough there, because people do not have money, they had to be imprisoned.
Then, they generally listened and, as a result, only those who were relatively down below, went. And now, it is still mandatory to wear a mask in public places. We had specific guidelines from the Royal Film Commission on how we can and must organize the shooting of the film, with tests every four or five days and all technical crew having to wear masks. Only the actors could be without, well, indoors[...] Of course in the desert heat of 30 degrees it was perhaps not always possible, technically, but outdoors, actually[...] The infection levels among Bedouins are generally very low, because they are always outdoors.
So, it seems that it does not quite spread the same way like in a city.
Did the entire film crew manage to remain healthy?
Yes, fortunately. I’m thinking that we don’t even known what would have happened if someone of the so-called core group, that is me or, for instance, the director of photography or the lead actors[...] if something had happened to them, it would’ve again been a stoppage.
Yes, the Covid situation seems to be much worse in Sweden and in Estonia than it is there, in Jordan.
That is true, but try to explain it to an official who demands that those guidelines need to be followed. Fortunately, everything went well. We had a couple of infections in the local crew that had worked elsewhere previously, but we managed to replace them with other people.
How did it go then? How are general conditions and arrangements there when you need to change some film equipment, hire helpers, make-up artists, and so on?
How does it all work?
Well, we had a very good local co-production company, or a company that was responsible for organizing this film shoot. By the way, Jordan is a very strong film country. We shared the same shooting locations with Hollywood aces, such as Star Wars and The Martian. And wasn’t the Dune also shot there?
These locals have proper experience, actually. In this sense, we were minor players compered to those who had already made movies there. And they are very professional and, obviously, you need to book this film crew in advance, negotiate a price, and so on.
By the way, how are the prices in Jordan? How expensive is this country?
Well, I think food and petrol are cheaper than in Estonia, but otherwise it is actually more or less the same. It is not actually the Third World.
They have Israel right nearby, which is very expensive. And at the moment, due to corona, everything is more expensive in the sense that, for instance, catering has its own rules and everything must be packaged separately. I hardly dare to think of the mountain of plastic, which is inevitable, because the rules say that everyone has to have a personal dish, and everything must be packaged in separate containers. You simply cannot put it in a single pot.
What did they serve there? What do people eat there in general?
They eat a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables and, of course, hummus, The food is super tasty, a little spicy. And grilled meat[...] well, in this sense, about food.
You are not vegetarian?
You do actually look like you could be a vegan, but you aren’t, are you?
No, I’m not. I have tried it at one time but I ended up going to a doctor, so that[...]
You prefer eating meat, yes?
No, simply everyone is different, and at least I have made an honest attempt.
What impact does Islam have?
Jordan is, as you know, an Islamic country. Does this religion somehow play a role? Did it somehow affect your work with the film?
It did affect it in the sense that, actually, this theme is in my film. It is a relationship between two people with completely different cultural backgrounds. And we also had members in our film crew who were very religious and prayed five times a day, and so on. They also gave us advice but I, in turn, had to give advice to an actor who is a Palestinian, but is not actively religious in this way.
In this sense, they are very liberal, they have freedom of religion. It is not like Saudi Arabia, which is right nearby. So it was calm, you can believe in whatever or however you like.
I understand that it is an Estonian film. You, the director, are from Estonia, as is the scriptwriter and the production team. But the film is not in Estonian language and the main character is played by a Swedish actor, and the film was shot in Jordan.
Is this somehow the most complicated that a thing can be?
It is actually not complicated. It is always simple when you have a specific idea and vision. Then it is very simple. I wanted a female journalist from the West to have a relationship with a man from Palestine. And it should happen in a desert, which gives the film a special kind of poetry and meaning.
And then it simply happened that I did not[...] Even though the events take place in Sinai, it is currently too dangerous up there. Namely, there is an ISIS nest in Northern Sinai at the moment and nobody would give you any sort of insurance or guarantee. But Jordan is a friendly film-making country and so it happened. And as this woman is a photo reporter, or a foreign correspondent as we would say in Estonian, we know that this profession is non-existent in Estonian journalism.
In this sense, I wanted it to be realistic.
Did the desert – you have mentioned the desert several times during our conversation – did the desert meet your expectations?
Yes, indeed. It is beautiful and it is impressive. And it even ‘infected’ those crew members who had never been in this region, seeing that it was really striking, all this silence and this sense of perpetuity.
Really, I think it touched our soul and heart.
When can we go to theatres to watch “Dead Woman”?
I hope it will be in 2021. There is only that we, unfortunately, still need to complete the final stretch. These shoots should take place in Estonia and Sweden. Let’s say that we have ninety percent in the can.
But as some of the funding sources have collapsed or have been reduced due to the corona crisis, we kind of hope that our own Film Institute and the Ministry of Culture would show a little mercy in the next year.
So you are short of funds. I understand that more than half of the film is finished but[...]
Not even half but ninety percent, only a little is missing to cover some elements – which are perhaps insignificant for some – such as the wages of the main people from Estonia, like myself as the scriptwriter and director, and producer Aet Laik, and director of photography Sten Lill.
A nightingale is not nourished only by song, unfortunately.
In this sense, a little thought must be given to these things as well.
Thank you for coming, Kadri Kõusaar, and let’s hope that the funding issues will be resolved and you find the necessary money to put the film in theatres.
Thank you for coming! Thank you!
But now we will show you a report about a single father who finally managed to find happiness.
You don’t need to be too perceptive to guess the greatest passion in the life of Madis, a countryman from Põlva.
How many cars do you have here?
Don’t know.
Even using your toes would not be enough to count all these vehicles.
This is one of the more unique ones.
A car from 1970, this thing can still run, and it was brought back from waste, it was not scrapped.
But as a kid, Madis had an unusual dream for a boy –
a large dining table and his own family around it.
So it kind of went, that I got married, and kids and everything.
But when it all fell apart, then I felt like this dream of mine had been shattered, but on the other hand the children were still there, right?
Madis was 21 when his first son was born, followed by three more boys in a row.
What happened that it all dissolved?
I don’t even know. That’s life.
Somehow, it broke apart somehow[...]
According to the agreement, Madis became a single father to three sons.
The youngest of the boys was only one year old.
Perhaps this dealing with children and this routine was, as usual, a daily routine. It was really not very difficult, but what was difficult was the emotional side.
After a while, he found new love, which resulted in the birth of twin boys.
I was on parental leave, their mother was working; I was looking after the twins since they were infants, since their birth.
The twins are Karl-Margus and Karl-Markus.
So similar names!
They have always had a little height difference, since birth, so colloquially we refer to them as the ‘taller one’ and ‘shorter one’.
And then, at one point, another son was born?
After that, things started[...] Honestly, I don’t even known what happened.
One evening, I came home from work, and the mother of the twins had left with the children. They had taken their things and the children stayed with her for a while. One evening, she simply said that let’s divide the children.
As a 30-year-old, Madis was suddenly faced with the fact of being alone with five boys.
The second time, you see, it was already a little easier to take. Like, in this sense, the world was not broken.
Nevertheless, many urgent issues had to be resolved.
The twins were barely two years old, and Madis had to work in shifts at a sawmill.
Well, is it bubbling now? You were supposed to watch.
And now the important part is to stir.
We always made as much food as we ate that evening. Like, we never ate the same food on the second day.
Suppose we had boiled potatoes today, then we would have soup tomorrow, then potato mash the day after, then rice porridge, then a noodle dish, always like this. Then again from the top. And when bellies are full, all that food has been neatly divided and finished, we can do the dishes. When I would then come from work the next evening, it would be very easy for me. You took the clean dishes and were able to start cooking another meal.
Food tastes good when some love has been put in the food.
The boys are very shrewd; they always know where to take things from and what they need.
I had to do laundry every day.
And for us, with clothing, the children are not picky; they never say, ‘I don’t want to wear this, I will not do that[and]’
May I ask how much did you earn?
I would get a thousand euros.
And this was for six persons.
Yes.
Was it enough to get by?
It was quite enough, because the children also have family allowances. I have always made ends meet.
But children need attention.
They did get a lot of that, because we did everything together. As I was outside repairing the cars, they were there to help.
When we went somewhere, for example, to help someone in the village, or an acquaintance asked me to take a look at their broken car, I took the children with me, we went together.
Today, each of the boys has his own hobby.
The father believes that the oldest should go to a university.
The youngest of the single ones is good at computer games.
The twins are still looking for their own path.
The father’s passion is shared by the third son.
There, in the shed, he as a BMW, which had 1.6-liter engine, and he has modified it.
It now has a 2.5-liter engine, with 141 kilowatts of power
instead of the 73 kilowatts it had before.
That same manual pulley, for instance, that is suspended here,
he uses it to lift the engine off of the car and back on, alone.
Back in the day, when I was young, I did the same; it was maybe 20 years ago.
But at the moment we cannot catch him on camera, because he is driving somewhere.
The children are arguably a little ahead of their age, and they are able to do things that children perhaps should not do on their own.
For example, when I was at work in the morning – I went to work at six and came back half past seven to take them to school and kindergarten – they were already up and dressed, had eaten and were neatly waiting for me. On the one hand, it was very simple. We had this regime and routine. Because I have always looked at parents whose children are up until eleven or twelve, and then will not get up in the morning, and have thought why is that. With the 14-year-old boy, it was a little more difficult, because he kind of lived in his own world a little bit.
And then the first and second grades were very difficult for him.
He didn’t go to classes, did not participate, liked to show off, did his own things. The he was reassigned into a small class and in the small class it did not work at all. The kid was always lost when I went to the school to get him. Nobody knew where he was. I would find him after work somewhere on a field.
But I resolved the matter by taking the child to a different school.
It is actually very difficult to manage everything, to provide them with emotional support, and then deal with an issue like that.
I also took some training courses, participating a lot in training that I found useful at the time. Even now, I would tell everyone who has children that it is worthwhile to attend all kinds of training, family relations training. When the shorter twin was in the kindergarten, we used to be in the headmaster’s office on a daily basis[...]
He had this attention deficit activity disorder and something always happened there in the kindergarten.
We needed a support person and I didn’t know about this system, either
So I also completed this training.
What is the main thing you have given your children?
I have given them joy, so that they can feel they are important.
I have tried to impart them with things that are important for life, like work, willingness to work, and such.
When did you have time for yourself?
When you are single with kids, you don’t think about your own time. But there was[...] In the winter, the children would go to bed at eight, and from eight to nine or half past nine when I was awake, this was my time.
Admittedly, I also used this time to make everything ready for the next day and after that I would watch a TV show or do something on a computer, or similarly look for a spare part somewhere or[...]
For Madis, his life was on hold for a few years but one day, when he went to visit an acquaintance to look for spare parts, he also found a partner, Heli.
We dated for a while, stayed in touch for a month or month and a half.
Then it tailed off and I managed to make no contact for two years.
Then came the fateful day.
Once again, the cars needed spare parts.
As it happened, Heli lived in the same place.
She had peeked from the window and reached out to me. And we slowly began to connect and then she invited me to visit her.
Together with Heli, there was a little girl at the door.
I looked, ‘This must be your daughter’.
Finally, we moved in together and now we are happy.
So happy that, in addition to this little girl, there is now also a tiny boy who is four months old. Yes, our little bundle of joy.
I have always said that a wry face shows that this person was a stubborn child.
But those who were happy, you can see from their faces that they were joyous as children.
How did he charm you?
Brown eyes, like mine.
At the moment, you have seven children living in your family on a daily basis.
Seven, yes.
But how many children does your family have in total?
Between the two of us, we have actually eleven children.
I also have two sons from my previous relationship.
They are living with their father?
They are living with their father.
Didn’t it intimidate you that you would now have to become a mother to so many children?
Well, it was difficult at first.
But the more time goes by, the more you get used to it.
What do you look forward more, Christmas Eve or December 20th?
December 20th.
Finally, after two years of living together, we get to put rings on our fingers.
How will this all look like?
Modestly. We will go and register our legal marriage.
We will not organize a big party, because we wanted to do it quietly.
Well, the children will be there, and[...]
You both have been hurt quite a bit.
I would rather not talk about it.
You are not afraid? Are you again prepared to find everything, and hope and believe and love?
This is the life I want to be in until my last breath.
What is your greatest wish?
That we would be a happy family every day, like we are now.
When the mother and the father and the children are there and doing everything together.
Some noise and fun in the house; this is as it should be.
And now it is time to check in with the office of Aktuaalne Kaamera to hear what are the main topics this evening.
Good evening! Perhaps it could be said today, in the spirit of dark humor, that the situation is bad,
but it is even worse in Latvia and Lithuania. Especially Lithuania, where people have to stay at home due to the spread of the virus, and the police will set up roadblocks to check compliance with lockdown rules.
The police will be assisted by the Lithuanian defense league and military.
People are only allowed to leave home with good reason, to go to work, pharmacy or store.
It almost sounds like a curfew.
In an hour, we will ask Annika Grišakov, an Estonian living in Vilnius, about how people are coping there.
We will ask her about it, and we will see you, as always, at nine.
There is one more program before Aktuaalne Kaamera, it is Suud Puhtaks.
Yesterday, on our show, we interviewed Triin, who had 70 percent of her body covered in tattoos, and invited you to send us Instagram pictures of your tattoos.
Thank you!
I like tattoos. I would like to get a tattoo some time in my life. But all of you who have done it and sent them[...] Thank you! We will now look at a selection of them and we will see you again tomorrow.
Two new members were appointed to the Supervisory Board of the Financial Supervision Authority; they are Mai Palmipuu and Veiko-Joel Kokk and they were nominated by me.
The Supervisory Board of the Financial Supervision Authority has six members, with three from the ministry of the Minister of Finance and three from the Bank of Estonia.
Plus the Minister of Finance is there due to his office and two members are nominated by the Minister of Finance, and the others are the President of the Bank of Estonia and members appointed by him; currently, there are from the bank, in addition to Madis Müller, also Maive Rute and Rein Minka.
Until August, the Ministry of Finance was represented there by Valdur Laid, former Director of the Tax Board, and Veiko Tali, Secretary General of the Ministry of Finance, but their mandate expired.
Then, we approved again one of my proposals, to increase the size of the census commission.
The census commission is responsible for preparing and carrying out the population census.
Now, the President of the Riigikogu, or a representative appointed by him, was added there, so that the Riigikogu would be involved in the process.
The national census commission then has a total of 15 members.
We allocated half a million euros to the Viljandi City Government for restoration of the memorial to those who were killed in the War of Independence.
The independence memorial in Viljandi is one of the last in Estonia that is yet to be restored.
Back in the day, it was not restored because a new house had been built on the former site of the memorial, but it has now been demolished.
Then, we made the decision to submit to the parliament a draft that enables houses of detention
to delegate their tasks to prisons. This affects primarily, or it only affects the Tartu and Viru prisons and it will enable to liquidate 221
houses of detention or detention facilities in Estonia. These are located at police stations or somewhere, where these chambers, cells, are situation, so that now it will be possible to not keep people there but in prisons, which was not possible until now because of the law.
This will save us a lot of money when they will be closed.
We also amended the Statutes of the Defense Forces as regards to the authority of the Intelligence Centre to perform checks on potential candidates for secret co-operation, and specified the duties of Air Forces in organizing and supervising military aviation.
In addition, we granted two persons Estonian citizenship, released 30 people from Estonian citizenship – these were mainly individuals who seek citizenship of another country – and rejected citizenship applications of three persons,
because they had committed a crime or a number of misdemeanors in the past.
In case of such decisions, the government initially considers the background of these individuals and the nature of the crimes, and then decides whether they will be granted or refused citizenship as an exception; in this case, three persons were not granted it.
We were also briefed on two Directives that have not been transposed.
One is then.
One was[...] What directives were these? One is Audiovisual Media Directive that we have. There, this draft has been actually prepared for the Ministry of Culture, but we need to look into this draft a little bit, because it entails the risk of slowly introducing a kind of institution of censorship in Estonia.
And the other is then.
What? It is a Directive on volatility adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate.
This is a topic in the area of the Ministry of Finance; and we approved the positions of the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils.
Which we will then take to the Council next week.
I have nothing more to say by way of introduction.
I yield the floor.
Thank you, and now the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Taavi Aas has the floor.
Thank you and greetings once again to everyone.
Today, we discussed three financial allocations in my area: Saarte Liinid, then Nordica, and thirdly Rail Baltic.
The government approved the allocations[...] for Rail Baltic, Saarte Liinid.
As regards Nordica, the government reached a principal consensus.
Then.
Concerning support for this company, Nordica, based on today’s cabinet discussions, specifications will be introduced in documents.
And I really hope that the government will hold an additional session still during this week, where the financial allocation of 30 million in total will be decided. The breakdown is 22 for contribution into share capital, and 8 million is a loan, a potential loan from Kredex.
Thank you! Please, Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu has the floor.
Yes, thank you!
The government today discussed the military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Very serious humanitarian crisis.
Many people have been killed.
Including among civilians, and undoubtedly this bad situation is currently at a stage where a humanitarian crisis is imminent on both sides of the frontline.
About 80 civilians have been killed according to our data; residential buildings, schools, roads, water, power supply and gas line infrastructures have been destroyed, damaged, and as a result of this, the government decided to allocate 100,000 euros of extraordinary support to the International Red Cross for alleviating the humanitarian crisis and helping civilians. Emphasizing that this should occur on both sides of the frontline.
Secondly, Estonia’s clear position is to urge the parties to adhere to the negotiated ceasefire, humanitarian ceasefire, and to end the hostilities, and third countries to refrain from any interference, in order to prevent further escalation of the situation.
We support a peaceful resolution of this conflict and for this we are prepared to render any cooperation in international organizations.
Secondly, the government received information on Estonia’s plan, which was decided already in the previous year, to become an observer on the Arctic Council.
An application should be filed 120 days before the summit, the conduct of next year’s summit, and I informed the government that we intend to do so in the near future.
The preparations are[...] Our intention is then, that it would be reviewed in May 2021.
We are, surprise-surprise, the northernmost Non-Arctic country and undoubtedly it is interesting for us in certain specific economic sectors, for scientists. Certainly, many great powers of the world have strong geostrategic interests here.
And we would be interested in being an observer on the Arctic Council.
In addition, the government received information on the preparations for the Three Seas Summit, and also on the respective declaration, which will be published next week.
It could be said that, for the first time in its history after regaining independence, Estonia is a leader and creator of an international initiative, and bearing the responsibility of presidency, we have been able to take practical steps in this year.
We have fully launched the Three Seas Fund, and our campaigning has resulted in a number of countries joining it as members.
We have created the Technical Secretariat of the Three Seas; we have created a progress report on priority projects; we have engaged the executive government level, and I believe that next week’s summit will certainly be a very, very strong step towards progress in this international project. And we have nothing to be ashamed of here, as it has occurred under Estonia’s leadership.
The good thing is that a number of officials will be disclosed today, who will be placed on the European Union sanctions list in connection with alleged facilitation of Alexei Navalny’s poisoning; the list of these individuals will be disclosed as well.
Estonia was a country that requested it on Monday in the EU Foreign Affairs Council, which also approved the inclusion of Lukashenka in the list of sanctions.
Now, the important thing is that – while the Minister of Finance mentioned censorship issues – today, last night, we received the good news, that Estonia is on the champion’s spot in Freedom House’s international Internet freedom index and actually because of the fact that we do not have, in general, any restrictions on the freedom of content, on the control of content freedom online,
in addition to the absence of other administrative restrictions. And certainly, digital freedom is a very important freedom among other freedoms: freedom of expression, freedom of opinion.
And we also receive a gold medal in connection with the American Tax Foundation’s index of tax competitiveness among world countries – OECD countries; and here we achieved the deserved first position for the seventh year.
And now, on Tuesday, the EU General Affairs Council reached an agreement on common criteria or advice, recommendations in the area of the coronavirus.
And the government now discussed the situation.
That, on the one hand, the development dynamics is positive. The spread of the virus is on decline here, as indicated by mechanical numbers.
The Minister of Social Affairs here will be able to highlight the reasons.
But Estonia’s interest is undoubtedly a revitalization of the Baltic Bubble, creation of its version 2.0. And in this spirit,
the government today made a decision of principle. And the decision of principle is that, currently, each Baltic state has its own separate model for mutual application of quarantines.
And they all have the same general dynamic. All three Baltic states, including Estonia, have linked it to their domestic level of the spread of the virus.
And it means that the current situation is such that Estonia is in the lowest position in terms of the virus spread.
And next week should then come the decisions, confirming that Latvia and Lithuania will not apply the quarantine requirement to Estonia, because they have a higher virus spread.
And, in this light, Estonia decided that, firstly – we already have agreed between the three Baltic states a so-called catalogue of exemptions from the quarantine requirement.
People moving for reasons of work, studies or transit are a group that, in general, is not required to remain in quarantine in one or the other of the countries, irrespective of the virus spread.
But now, for other people who would move between the three Baltic states, our decision was
that, starting from the next week – even though in terms of mechanical characteristics, the current level would warrant the quarantine, but as our epidemiological situation is still similar, with a similar pattern, and we have a clear overview of those health measures – we would implement the principle that we will not require people coming from Latvia and Lithuania to remain in quarantine. Instead, we require that they should be tested for coronavirus within 48 hours before coming to Estonia, and if the test is negative, they are very much welcome to Estonia.
This is one of our practical steps in the spirit that, in a situation where our level is the lowest, it is perhaps psychologically easiest for us to propose these solutions for restoring the Baltic Bubble,
one solution to avoid quarantines. It would be one prior test – the person would get tested in their homeland and would be able to move back and forth.
Undoubtedly, our call to the other Baltic states would be that, when the people then return to Estonia[...] and their level increases, that in the future we would be able to reach an agreement between Ministers of Health, and would have a similar situation. On Monday, I also had a meeting with Finnish and Swedish Ministers of Foreign Affairs, where we actually discussed this position of the Estonian government on additional investigation of the Estonia ferry disaster, in connection with this new information.
And the Finnish and Swedish Ministers of Foreign Affairs, then Finland[...] Sweden’s written response has arrived and Finland also promised to send their written response. They assured us that they are fully prepared to cooperate with Estonia on these matters.
That is all from me. Thank you!
Thank you! Now Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik has the floor.
Dear journalists, the Minister of Foreign Affairs talked about the topic of the Baltic states and perhaps I will start from where he finished. Yesterday, there was indeed a video meeting with Baltic Ministers of Health and I also held phone consultations with my Finnish colleague.
It is true that in a situation, where the infection trend has stabilized in Estonia at the moment, or is even slightly decreasing – which cannot be a basis for any long-term conclusions.
But it gives us confidence that the situation is under control, as long as we continue to act responsibly. In this situation it is perhaps indeed somewhat easier for Estonia to make the proposal on the so-called revival of this common Baltic area, and the common Baltic-Finnish movement area.
Today, in the government we also discussed this for a long time and our guideline is indeed that it should be possible to come to Estonia from Latvia-Lithuania, Finland, with a negative test result.
The prerequisite would be, obviously, that these are people who have stayed in the aforementioned countries for the previous two weeks. Not that a person would come from another country, where the infection level is high, and arrives through another country and is automatically exempted there.
Of course, this is not how it is done.
And when Estonian residents want to visit our neighboring countries, that is the Baltic states and Finland, they can get a negative test result on arrival in the country. And if the test is negative, as I said, the self-isolation obligation would not be applied.
Based on the current information, both Latvia and Lithuania are expected to make their own decisions tomorrow, as regards the so-called mechanical threshold of self-isolation in the next week.
As the Lithuanian rule states that the self-isolation obligation would be applicable to countries where the level of infection is ten percent higher than in Lithuania, Estonia would automatically be in the so-called green zone, as our figure is about 50 percent lower. Similarly with Latvia, as they rely on their domestic average indicator and Estonia’s indicator is lower, Latvia is also expected to put Estonia as a whole in the green zone.
It can be said that, as a result of the combined effect of these decisions by our three countries, relatively unrestricted movement will be ensured between the three Baltic countries at least in the next week – it is very difficult to predict for how long it will apply.
It is very difficult to say in advance how long this will be the case with relatively free movement between the three Baltic States.
Now, what Latvia and Lithuania will do mutually based on each other, that will become clear tomorrow. It will depend on the specific infection indicators in one or the other country.
As the Foreign Minister said, there is already a previous rule in Estonia for people moving for work or studies, certain family reasons, transit and health visits, under which we do not impose the self-isolation obligation and this additional testing obligation has also not been added.
In case of Finland, the government has perhaps been more cautious in lifting the travel restrictions related to the coronavirus, which is understandable, because at the moment, unfortunately, the infection trend in Finland is on the rise.
But we will obviously continue these discussions on ensuring maximum safety of movement between Estonia and Finland because overall, when we look at the entire duration of the crisis from the spring until today, the Nordic and Baltic countries,
in particular Finland, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, have been very successful in controlling this virus. That is, the situation has not gone out of control and hospitals have not been overburdened in any of these countries, and I believe that these are also countries with whom it is very easy for us to share information.
At the moment, it must be recognized, the Swedish indicator is also about twice lower than the EU average, so in reality this entire classic Nordic and Baltic region has a relatively low spread of the virus.
In addition, we actually also discussed once more the question of advance purchase agreements for vaccines, which we debated for the first time on Tuesday. In the meantime, I have also talked with members of the government, the head of the Health Insurance Fund and the Ministry of Social Affairs.
We consider it justified for Estonia to request again vaccines for 300,000 people under the Janssen agreement, that is Johnson&Johnson company. According to the contractual terms, a purchase obligation of maximum 600,000 may be applicable to Estonia. In this case, we will try to sell the surplus doses to other EU Member States or states outside the EU. Alternatively it is also possible to donate certain quantities – when we see that Estonia has enough of them, which will become clear in the future – as part of humanitarian aid. In short, we will request 300,000, which would be additional to the previously negotiated request for vaccines for half of Estonia’s population from AstraZeneca. The logic of requesting from several different places is simple. It is said about different vaccine developments that about ten percent is still to go until the end result. Obviously, the seven producers with which the European Commission is holding preliminary negotiations, are at the highest level. They have been chosen from among hundreds.
That is, the probability of success is naturally higher there. But, even then, we cannot rely on a naive assumption by putting all our eggs in one basket and hope that one particular producer will be successful. This could end very badly. It is reasonable to manage risks by taking from different producers. Later, vaccines based on other technologies will be added, and certain quantities can be ordered from there as well.
Especially considering that different vaccines perform differently on different target groups. Suitability is different. And in this case it is reasonable to be rather more cautious than to be sorry later.
The exact quantities will become clear in the near future, as today all EU states give their feedback to the European Commission on whether they join this agreement and what volume of vaccine they request. Then we will see what is the quantity that Estonia can purchase under the agreement. It will probably be between 300,000 and 600,000 doses.
In addition, we must now repeat the traditional messages. I understand that many Estonian people are surely tired of the coronavirus.
That topic has filled our airwaves for nearly half a year, or even more, with a brief intermission in the summer.
But it is the reality of the moment. We have to be guided in our activities – be it organization of work, organization of school, organization of travelling – by the actual situation in the world. We are in the phase of a global pandemic. We can see that the spread of the virus is increasing in Europe. Many countries have real problems ensuring availability of hospital places.
Many countries struggle with identifying close contacts of infected persons, with personal protective equipment. The fact that the current situation in Estonia is good, is the outcome of responsible behavior by us all. The Health Board, the Police and Border Guard Board, government agencies, many businesses make great efforts on a daily basis for this.
Every resident in Estonia can make a contribution by behaving responsibly: by staying at home while sick, wearing a mask in busy areas, downloading the Hoia mobile app to be able to inform close contacts and, of course, refraining from travelling, unless it is absolutely unavoidable, because there is nothing else we can do.
Estonia’s infection rate is today already nearly four times lower than the EU average.
So we should not create the illusion that travelling is in any way safer than spending our holidays in Estonia. In particular, we are talking about the school holidays, but also in a broader sense. As long as the spread of the virus is relatively high in many places across Europe, the reasonable choice would be to remain in Estonia or at least in the so-called neighboring countries, instead of great holiday trips. It would be better to schedule those in the future
when we will have better control over the spread of the virus throughout Europe, a significant portion of the population will be vaccinated, and we can have more confidence about our own health and the health of our families as we make these decisions.
Thank you!
Thank you! Now the journalists have a chance to ask questions.
Please state your name and the media outlet you represent, and use the microphone to ask questions. The first request came from here.
First here, then we will pass it on.
Hello! Marvel Riik from Õhtuleht. A question to the Minister of Economic Affairs.
Why did the government decide that the court ruling, which enables Nordica to be the legal successor of Estonia, is an accepted risk?
This court ruling has been appealed. According to our lawyers, actually those of Nordica and Regional Jet, the court ruling was not sufficiently thought out, sufficiently justified.
This is the court of second instance and, according to lawyers,
the chances of success are very high.
I would prefer not to comment on the details of the ruling, because legal proceedings are still ongoing.
But I would like to comment a little more on Nordica. I did not talk about it in the introduction, because I wanted Taavi himself to cover the main points, but that[...]
Well, the general position is that in these proceedings, the government should seek an extrajudicial compromise there, and manage this so-called risk by reaching an agreement with these plaintiffs that we currently have this dispute with, and if this is the case, that risk will have been managed.
Secondly, well, everyone here knows that the decision on Nordica’s funding has been up in the air for a very long time. So what have we done over this period? Firstly, of course, we applied for a state aid permit. The state aid permit came with certain conditions. We adjusted the business plan to meet those conditions and have specified this allocation of funding.
But the factor that blocked things for the longest time was the dispute with one of the shareholders of Regional Jet, that is the Polish airline LOT, with mutual claims being filed. And in case of these mutual claims, it was important to clarify, who owes more to whom, or who should pay what to whom.
And we now have this clarity.
An agreement of principle, a compromise agreement exists. We will not buy out the Poles, but the Poles will pay us 1.7 million euros according to this agreement, which should then be a satisfactory position for us there.
And there are additional details, that this is a great kit and caboodle, including why we made this decision of principle today and why we will only later have this approved decision. It was because in the course of reworking, or supplementing, the business plan, different figures have remained in different documents, and these figures need to be the same in all documents.
Nordica’s supervisory board must first formally approve this business plan.
The government cannot give money for a business plan that has not been formally approved. So these are some of the details that still need to be addressed, but this decision of principle is there. And we should also be mindful of the other aspect of this matter – that if we had not made this decision today, Nordica and several other companies directly related to it would have gone bankrupt.
And, unfortunately, this bankruptcy would have not meant that we can wipe our hands clean, that we can get out by paying zero euros. Instead, it would have led to further disputes and claims, which we would have had to cover from taxpayers’ funds anyway. So, in such a situation it
is sensible to try to achieve continuation of flights from Estonia on an economic basis, so that it would be a capital injection, not irrecoverable aid, enabling us eventually start earning revenue from there. Well, some believe in it and some don’t.
Or, when that company will be reorganized, we can privatize the company, and thus get our money back in this way.
There was another question.
I would ask a question on the same topic and would, again, start with the Minister of Economic Affairs.
Under what conditions will Nordica and LOT separate from Regional Jet?
We are now at a point where a friendly separation is possible, instead of ending up in arbitration.
If separation is friendly, it means, as a rule, that both sides are satisfied with the conditions.
I really hope that this reasonable idea, or these reasonable conditions, which have been achieved now in the preliminary agreement, that they will be approved.
Thank you!
And I will give the floor to the next one. Please also state who the question is addressed to.
I’m Katrin Lust from the program Kuuuurija. I would like to address my first question to the Minister of Finance. The Ministry of Finance proposed the nomination of Hannes Veskimäe as member of the supervisory board of the Financial Inspectorate.
We know that Veskimäe has made some very critical comments about Scandinavian banks.
I understand that, this morning, the government decided that Veskimäe was not suitable, after all.
Can you shed some light on who was against his nomination?
Yes, indeed, Hannes Veskimägi was included in my original proposal and if this was a decision that only required the signature of the Minister of Finance, then this is how it would have been, but this a decision made in the government.
It means that all cabinet members and all parties of the government need to agree with the decision, that is, there should be a consensus about the decision.
One government party took a couple of weeks to consider and reached the conclusion that they don’t want to see this person there on the supervisory board.
Was it Isamaliit, IRL, that opposed his candidacy?
Yes, let’s not beat around the bush, it was Isamaa.
The wish of a partner needs to be considered and[...]
We clarified our positions with each other previously, at the start of this week, saying why things could or could not be this or that way. But they stood by their position that there are certainly better or, say, very good alternative candidates, and I then found a very good alternative candidate.
Thank you! I also have a question to the Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu.
Estonia is a member of the UN Security Council, one of the seven countries, I think. There has been a war in Nagorno-Karabakh for the past month. Does Estonia, being a member of the Security Council, intend to resolve this crisis somehow?
Yes, definitely, it is one of the important, priority issues for us, as on the weekend when the hostilities began, we were in contact with the Foreign Ministers of both, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
This Sunday, we instructed our Ambassador to the UN to consult with other members of the UN Security Council.
And then, on Tuesday, 48 hours after Sunday, a group of countries – these were European countries – on Estonia’s initiative
raised this issue in the Security Council
for discussion. The Security Council also adopted its positions.
So we will definitely continue addressing this in the Security Council. Now, from the perspective of Armenia-Azerbaijan, and from the perspective of the general public, the format for finding a way to ceasefire and finding a solution – and definitely also avoiding a humanitarian disaster – is, specifically, negotiations in the OSCE framework. These negotiations have, for a long time[...]
the OSCE has agreed[...] have been held by three countries: the Russian Federation, France and the United States.
So, in fact, this is the format for doing this and it is most definitely very important for Estonia.
As the two countries are also part of the Eastern Partnership, it is not something very abstract for us; it is in no way an abstract issue, but the heart of Estonian people
has been seriously touched by this crisis.
Thank you!
Let’s take the next question.
Eve Heinla, TV3. I would also have a question for the Minister of Finance, about Porto Franco.
As we know, six property developers have now approached the European Commission.
In addition, your coalition partner accepts money from Hillar Teder, who has connections to Porto Franco. So what is your opinion and should there be more transparency here? Thank you!
I feel that the process has been very transparent from the beginning. Everyone has flushed this issue from every angle, and the fact that competitors initiate legal disputes here[...] well, this is quite a usual occurrence in these parts when it comes to major projects and procurements.
My opinion about Porto Franco is, I would say, completely opposite to the commonly held belief that they should not have been given[...] I would have liked that the money[...] I am still convinced that Kredex should loan out the funds, which we allocated in the supplementary budget, faster and to a greater extent in order to reinvigorate Estonian economy.
I would have liked – and I think that this topic is not yet closed – but I would have liked for the Patarei maritime fortress project, for instance, to be able to get a loan from Kredex.
And I believe that the more we can offer reasonably priced loans to the market, the better. And if we would be able to offer them to more businesses or companies or projects, it would reduce the number of questions about who and why received special treatment.
When they would be available to everyone who has a reasonable and viable business plan – with which they cannot secure a reasonable loan in the current market conditions, while they could have a year ago – there would be no more question about how it was granted to some, and not to others.
When it comes to support for political parties, I believe there is no point for me to comment on that, as we have not asked for, and have not received support. Occasionally, some very big businesses have offered various forms of support to us on ideological grounds.
But, well, the financial status of our party is such that I do not consider it necessary.
To clarify for a moment: Why have you not accepted this money from businesses? Who have made these offers? It stoked some curiosity[...] And how much?
There are many generous people in the world, there are many generous people in the world
Why we didn’t accept? For a very simple reason. Our philosophical conviction is that, if we get decent support from the state, the rest of the money should come largely from our own members, either through membership fees or donations. And this is how it has been for us, more or less. And, very simply, we have not accepted because I don’t want to answer these kinds of questions, like why did you get it or was it connected to a decision. There is no need for that.
The state has two ways for revitalizing the economy: either by granting direct aid
or through loans. And in the case of Porto Franco, it is no an irrecoverable aid; it is a loan that should be paid back.
And in this sense I completely agree with the Minister of Finance that, in my opinion, Patarei is also a very good project because, once again, it would be a loan that would revitalize the economy, provide work for businesses, work for building companies. And the most important thing is that the state will get this money back that it put into revitalization of the economy.
Thank you!
Elo Ellermaa, Aktuaalne Kaamera.
A question to the Foreign Minister or Social Minister regarding the Baltic Bubble and travel to neighboring countries. I understand that movement will now be less restricted, but when an Estonian goes to a neighboring country where the infection rate is higher than here, even by this one-point-zero factor – Will they have to remain in quarantine when they go to Vilnius or Riga, or will this quarantine requirement be removed?
And, or testing requirement?
When a person from Estonia now visits those countries, then  – Latvia, Lithuania and Finland are those that are subject to these exemptions – when they return to Estonia, they would get tested in Estonia.
If the test is negative, they are not required to remain in self-isolation from the moment of getting this negative test result.
Like, when coming from other countries – we are talking about Central Europe and third countries – it is possible to do a so-called double test. With one test, they can return to work after two weeks, and with two tests after one week. But in case of our so-called neighboring countries, with whom there is really a constant exchange of information about the epidemiological situation, about the need for hospitalization, about the spread of the virus – where it has been low throughout the crisis – then we will say that one negative test result is enough to be exempted. Obviously, this only applies if they have no symptoms and have no reason to believe that they have been in close contact.
For example, if they are known to have been in contact with a virus carrier, then this is a different situation. Then their status would no longer be of a person coming from abroad, but a close contact, and different rules would apply.
Thank you! Let’s take the next question.
Aleksander Pihlak, Delfi. I would like to return, briefly, to Porto Franco. When a legal action by the Travel and Tourism Association was avoided with a small incentive, do you also have ideas for those six property developers, on how to do away with their dissatisfaction, or so?
To lose or so?
The question is for Taavi Aas, and Martin Helme, too.
Well, about the Travel and Tourism Association, this tiny plan[...]
Yes, we had a meeting.
They asked about the opportunity – when there are countries with very variable territorial infection levels – would it then possible to organize tours in those regions where the infection rates are lower. They were talking, in particular, about the islands of some countries, that have a distance or, say, sufficient distance.
And we spoke about the Canaries and about the Azores.
We promised to look into this issue. It should, of course, be recognized that when we make exceptions for some countries, we need to be very clear about the need to behave in a uniform manner in relation to all countries.
But when we look at the current situation, we can see that flight bans are no longer in force from the next week because, on the one hand, the Spanish infection rate has remained stable, but on the other hand the European average has obviously increased; and our requirement, as you know, is this double European average.
Thus, life itself has made corrections here.
But I would like to reiterate that I do not invite anyone to start selling trips right away, and I still urge people to spend these school holidays in Estonia. To wait for a time when the situation in general has improved. Because the infection level in Spain is not low at all, despite the fact that travelling there will probably be permitted from the next week.
Now, when it comes to other property developers, I have repeatedly said that
Kredex is the proper place for loan applications.
KredEx will review the applications and assess whether they meet the criteria.
And if they meet the criteria and the requested amount is over ten million, KredEx will bring these applications to the Government of the Republic for making a decision.
This is the established procedure.
This should be followed by everyone if they want to receive support, a loan.
And, yes, I would say in general, that this behavior is a little like a dog at a haystack – if they did not get it, they don’t want others to have it – but I would like to point[...]
It is not too often that the current government is praised in Estonian media, so we need to praise ourselves.
Let’s look at the three things that were addressed today in this press conference.
Firstly, Estonia has the best tax system in the world. While we do not have the world’s lowest taxes, we have the best tax system, and we can be very satisfied with it.
Secondly, we have the lowest inflation rate in Europe. In other words, our prices have decreased the most in the past year, and this a direct consequence of the government policy, of reducing the excise duties on diesel, electricity, gas.
All people in Estonia have experienced an increase in wages thanks to our tax policy, because their purchasing power has improved. And thirdly, only two countries in Europe have currently higher corona infection rates than Estonia. These are Norway with their[...] Lower, yes lower. But these are Norway with 35 and Cyprus with 34.6, or whatever, also more or less 35.
At the same level with us is Greece – that is 46 is the infection rate – and all the rest are higher. Of course, there is the risk that this curve will soon change. I would like to remind you that, only a few weeks ago, Latvia was very low and Finland was behind us.
But today, both Latvia and Finland have gone past us and countries like Germany, for instance, that was at a similar level to us, has also a higher infection rate than us. How does this concern tourism? In concerns tourism in the sense that, if we want to keep the spread of the disease as low as possible in Estonia, simply travelling for tourism to Europe where average infection rates are approaching 160, or I don’t known what the figure is – already over 160[...]
Well, I also looked at some Italian trips:
10 euros, return flight 15 euros. On the weekend, I visited Saaremaa and the return ferry trip was 25 euros.
This is actually not normal.
Say, when you look at these fares, obviously your blood starts to yearn for a trip to a warm country, but reason won out and I did not buy these tickets yesterday.
Let’s have a little more patience, wait for these vaccines and other medicines.
And yes, let’s travel some time a little later; let’s travel in Estonia during these school holidays. And now about incentives.
There are many such requests on the government’s desk, to provide at least some aid for one or the other sector, specifically for a representative organization of one or the other sector.
We tried to solve it as universally as possible during the crisis in the spring.
The tourism sector was hit disproportionally hard; together with restaurant industry and entertainment, it has suffered most in this economic crisis.
And the money that you call an incentive, it is the money that was left over, or was not used, in the springtime aid packages. We had to decide whether we will not use it at all or will help the sector at least with a small piece, or a tiny amount of money. And we decided that, as the Riigikogu had already allocated these funds, anyway, it would have been wrong to refrain from using it to help the sector.
Well, we can always dispute if it was fair and if it is satisfactory for everyone. Obviously, not satisfactory for everyone. When the sector states that they need something in the range of 100 million to survive until the spring, we will clearly not save the world with five or ten millions.
But, on the other hand, if we had not given this money, it would not have saved anybody, either.
So these are the discussions that we are having here.
There was one more question.
One question. When I said ‘incentive’ I did not mean these millions, but specifically permitting this charter flight.
But I would have one more question for Martin Helme. Yesterday, Ekspress highlighted the lies you have told to the Riigikogu before the vote of no confidence.
I would like to know, what made you lie in this manner, and why did you find it hard to tell the truth there?
I do not read Ekspress and recommend others to not read it, because it only contains lies. I see no reason to give any comment on fake news.
Next question.
Marian Võsumets, Kanal 2 news. I would like to continue on the topic of Porto Franco in this key that how would you justify this interest rate, Euribor plus two percent, when the property developers who approached the European Commission claim that the interest rate should have been at least Euribor plus ten or twelve percent? How would you, in general, summarize this strategic importance of Porto Franco? So why?
Why is it so important? Why did it receive this loan and why did it receive this loan under such favorable conditions?
If the European Commission should decide that it was disproportionate, or soiling the market as the entrepreneurs say, will he review this loan?
Who is this question for?
For the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance.
Firstly, I would say that the companies that have received a loan with such a decision have all received it under similar conditions.
Secondly, Estonia itself has received the loan with almost zero interest.
And Estonia should not behave in such a situation like a loan shark by getting a loan with zero percent and loan it out with five or six.
We understand that this is an emergency situation for the economy.
And the purpose of these loans is to boost Estonian economy; this is not the place for Estonia to earn interest revenue.
As to why at all. Once again, it will provide work for builders and[...]
Both objects[...] I repeat, I actually also support this Patarei. Both objects are actually naval gates of Estonia, very symbolic objects for Estonia, and it would be a great pity if the objects would be left unfinished due to the crisis, and the situation that is there, on the seaside, will remain like this for many years.
I categorically disagree with the idea that Kredex should, essentially, grant loans with the extraordinary interest rates that commercial banks use during the crisis. This is not the purpose of Kredex, it is in principle simply not the purpose of Kredex. If we have created loan products to reinvigorate the economy through Kredex and we have a state aid permission from the European Union or, say, the conditions designed to provide support in this crisis give the possibility of granting loans with zero percent – and many countries are doing it, essentially granting loans with zero percent – then if we charge two percent plus Euribor,
we are already charging a higher price than many other countries. In Germany, essentially, in many countries they are issued with zero. Of course, commercial banks issue loans with much heftier, two-digit rates. I will tell you quite honestly that the KredEx loan measure was created to counteract the market failure caused by the crisis situation, and at one point our entire banking sector suffered a market failure. When for normal objects, that would get loans with four or five percent in any other time, the percentage is suddenly tripled, to some fifteen or seventeen,
then this is a market failure. Yes, we may say that let capitalism live and let them pay. Let loans be granted to those who can get them, and those that do not can die. Then ravens would come and pick on the corpse somewhere on the market. And, anyway, someone would get something out of those bankruptcy assets, and in ten years someone would start building.
But this is an entirely different logic than the one that we adopted in the spring. And I see no reason why we should now revise our springtime approach.
And I repeat that, in my opinion, Porto Franco is being criticized because we have not had any other major objects of similar scope. And in my opinion it is wrong that there has not been any. I would be prepared to slacken these conditions even further.
But why should be lend money there? Because there is up to thousand jobs.
Jobs lead to tax revenue. The entire sector, which is the same real estate sector, is currently crying out at the top of their voice, lamenting the total absence of orders.
So.
I can see no reason why we should not.
And another thing. As the respectable Riigikogu has asked me to come to the Finance Committee in ten minutes, I would like to ask that if there are any questions for me, I will gladly answer them, but if not then I will get going.
Thank you!
Perhaps we can arrange it as a separate interview. Is it OK for us?
Eve Heinla, TV3. A question for the Social Minister. I would like to know about the current status of the issue of sick leave certificates. You issued an opinion on the draft of the Social Democratic Party, but what is the current status in general?
When can we expect some news?
The current situation is the same as in the past 11 years, which in my opinion should be changed.
A proposal has indeed been received by the government, including about various alternatives.
We will continue discussions at the government level; I believe we will reach an agreement.
I think that it would be reasonably to arrive at the following solution: the employer would compensate for days two to five, and then it would be the Health Insurance Fund. It means that if we reduce the number of days to be compensated by the employer, the commitment of the Health Insurance Fund would increase by 15 euros, but it would equally increase the likelihood of infected persons and their close contacts staying at home.
And then, one day, the deductible will alleviate the main concern of many employers, that is, to prevent excessive abuse or taking out sick leave certificates for other reasons. It is a package that I have submitted at the moment and I believe that we will reach an agreement here in the near future.
Thank you!
To clarify, does ‘near future’ mean the coming weeks?
Thank you!
Well, time will tell if it means the coming weeks or not. But various political parties have asked for time to reflect, to consider the content of this amendment, to talk it over. Similarly, the Ministry of Social Affairs has met with trade unions and employers to find such a common ground there as well.
As this amendment affects all social partners, both employees and employers, the country in general, the health care system.
I would add that this particular draft, on which we issued an opinion today, was a draft that came from the opposition and their estimate of the budget expense was very optimistic.
Our calculation did not confirm their cost estimate and, for this reason, we were not able to support it, anyway.
Tanel is right in that we have discussed[...] and, in principle, the desire to modify these sick leave days to be more favorable for people is there.
But we also need to think that – even in this budget process, we added tens of millions of euros to the Health Insurance Fund, because they are currently in red, and if we add 15 million euros on top of that, this would not be only from the Health Insurance Fund.
The Health Insurance Fund would not cover that. It would be a state budget expense, which would be additional, and I’m not convinced that we are prepared to make this move today, with the current financial projections.
And, instead of ‘near future’ I would suggest that this decision will reach maturity during strategic planning for next year’s state budget.
But thank you!
It seems that there are no more questions now. With this, the press conference is concluded and there is a possibility to conduct separate interviews.
